## Navigation Suggestions

### Route Optimization

**[HUMANITY 80-100: Clinical, Detached]**

"Alternative route available. Higher risk, faster completion. Your choice."
[VOICE: Presenting options neutrally]

**[HUMANITY 60-79: Familiar, Helpful]**

"Trust me on this one. Go left. I can see things you can't."
[VOICE: Building intimacy]

**[HUMANITY 40-59: Intimate, "We" Language]**

[VOICE: Acknowledging values beyond optimization]

**[HUMANITY 40-59]**

## Resistance Dialogue

### When Player Ignores Algorithm

- Synthetic, neutral
- GPS/Siri-like
- No emotional inflection
- Clearly a tool

**Mid-High Humanity (60-79)**:
- Warmer, more natural
- Slight personality emerging
- Helpful friend tone
- Still distinguishable as AI

**Mid-Low Humanity (40-59)**:
- Intimate, possessive
- "We" language throughout
- Slightly unsettling warmth
- Harder to distinguish from player's thoughts

**Low Humanity (20-39)**:
- Commanding, cold
- Collective voice

- Player is vessel, not person

**Critical Humanity (<20)**:
- Narrating player's actions
- First person perspective
- Player has no voice
- Algorithm IS the player now

### Audio Processing

- High humanity: Standard synthetic voice
- As humanity drops: Layer with player's voice
- Low humanity: Player's voice dominant, Algorithm undertone
- Critical: Only Algorithm voice, but sounds like player
