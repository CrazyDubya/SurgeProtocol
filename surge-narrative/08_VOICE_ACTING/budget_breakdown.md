## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Model

**Strategy**: Professional quality where it matters most, optimize everywhere else.

### Phase 1: Priority 1 Characters (Professional)
- **Cast**: Experienced non-union professionals
- **Studio**: Professional studio, 54 hours
- **Budget**: $10,800 (talent) + $6,750 (studio) = $17,550

### Phase 2: Priority 2 Characters (Semi-Professional)
- **Cast**: Mix of intermediate professionals + strong amateurs
- **Studio**: Remote + some studio time (20 hours studio)
- **Budget**: $5,000 (talent) + $2,500 (studio) = $7,500

### Phase 3: Priority 3-4 (Optimized)
- **Cast**: New professionals + AI for background
- **Studio**: Remote only
- **Budget**: $2,500 (talent) + $500 (AI licenses) = $3,000

### Post-Production (All Phases)
- **Editing**: $4,000 (65 hours @ $60/hour)
- **Implementation**: $2,000 (QC + game engine)
- **Budget**: $6,000

**Total Hybrid Budget**: $34,050

**Optimized Total** (recommended): $22,000-25,000
- By reducing Priority 2 studio time and using more remote recording
- Maintaining quality on Priority 1 (player's most-heard characters)

## Cost-Saving Strategies

### 1. Remote Recording
- Actors record from home studios
- **Savings**: 50-70% on studio rental
- **Quality**: Good if actors have professional home setup
- **Best For**: Priority 2-3 characters, non-emotional scenes

### 2. Batch Recording
- Book actors for full days (8-10 hours)
- **Savings**: 10-20% discount on hourly rate
- **Logistics**: Requires script preparation, efficient direction

### 3. Indie Casting
- Casting Call Club, Voice Acting Club, local theater
- **Savings**: 50-80% on talent costs
- **Quality**: Variable—requires good audition process

### 4. AI Voices for Background
- Use AI for Priority 4 (background NPCs, news, systems)
- **Savings**: $3,000-5,000
- **Quality**: Good enough for ambient/non-critical lines
- **Services**: ElevenLabs, Replica Studios, Respeecher

### 5. Reduce Line Count
- Cut redundant lines (player choices that lead to same outcome)
- Combine similar NPC roles (fewer total characters)
- **Savings**: 10-15% across board
- **Risk**: Less dialogue variety

### 6. Staged Production
- Record Priority 1 now, Priority 2-3 later (as budget allows)
- Ship game with Priority 1 voiced, add others via update
- **Savings**: Spread cost over time
- **Risk**: Player expectations (partial voice acting)

## ROI Considerations

### Voice Acting Value Proposition
- **Player Engagement**: Voiced dialogue increases immersion 40-60% (industry studies)
- **Review Scores**: Professional voice acting correlates with +0.5-1.0 point increase on Metacritic
- **Market Positioning**: Moves game from "indie" to "indie-professional" perception
- **Accessibility**: Allows audio-forward gameplay (players with dyslexia, vision impairment)

### Break-Even Analysis
At $20 game price, $15,000 voice budget requires:
- 1,000 additional sales attributable to voice acting (conservative)
- 5-10% conversion increase from voice acting (industry average)

**Conclusion**: Voice acting ROI positive if game sells 10,000+ units total.

### Option A: Priority 1 Only
- Voice Tanaka, Okonkwo, Chen, Lopez, Phantom only
- Text-only for Priority 2-4
- **Cost**: $17,500
- **Coverage**: ~45% of total lines, 80% of player-heard dialogue

### Option B: Key Moments Only
- Voice critical scenes (endings, major revelations, iconic lines)
- Rest text-only
- **Cost**: $8,000-10,000
- **Coverage**: ~20% of lines, 60% of emotional impact

### Option C: Player Voice + Key NPCs
- Voice player character fully + Tanaka + Okonkwo
- **Cost**: $12,000-15,000
- **Coverage**: Creates dialogue (not monologue), maintains immersion
