### Character-Based Structure

Dialogue is organized by character rather than by quest/scene. Each character document contains:
1. **Character Profile**: Age, background, personality, key traits
2. **Voice Direction**: Vocal qualities, accent, speaking patterns, emotional range
3. **Iconic Lines**: 10-15 most important/memorable lines (priority recording)
4. **Full Dialogue Breakdown**: All lines organized by context (quest, scene, emotional state)
5. **Recording Notes**: Special considerations, difficult pronunciations, character arc notes

**Total Priority 3**: ~800-1,050 lines

### Priority Tier 4 (Background - Record Last or Stock)
Minor characters, ambient dialogue, can use stock/AI voices:
- Generic NPCs (vendors, guards, civilians)
- Background chatter
- News anchors
- Automated systems

**Total Priority 4**: ~500-800 lines (estimated)

## Voice Direction Philosophy

### Cyberpunk Noir Aesthetic
- **Tone**: Grounded, weary, cynical but not hopeless
- **Pacing**: Deliberate, not rushed (characters think before speaking)
- **Emotion**: Restrained (augmented people struggle with emotions, not overwrought)
- **Technical Terms**: Characters say technical terms naturally (chrome, Tier, augments are everyday vocabulary)

### Augmentation Impact on Voice
Characters with heavy chrome may have subtle vocal processing:
- **Neural augments**: Slight digital echo on certain words (optional post-processing)
- **Respiratory augments**: Even breathing, no panting/gasping even after exertion
- **Facial chrome**: Slight mechanical quality to consonants

**Note**: Augmentation effects should be SUBTLE, not robotic. Characters are still human.

### Cultural Diversity
Characters have diverse backgrounds reflected in accent/speech patterns:
- **Dr. Tanaka**: Japanese-American, West Coast American accent, medical precision
- **Kwame Okonkwo**: Nigerian, calm measured speech, slight West African accent
- **Maria Lopez**: Latina, passionate but controlled, working-class register
- **Chen**: Chinese-American, older generation, fatherly warmth

**Important**: Avoid stereotypical "ethnic" voices. These are real people, not caricatures.

## Recording Session Organization

### Session Structure Recommendation

**Session 1: Priority 1 Characters** (Estimated: 15-20 hours recording)
- Dr. Tanaka (full dialogue)
- Kwame Okonkwo (full dialogue)
- Chen (full dialogue)

**Session 2: Priority 1 Characters Continued** (Estimated: 12-15 hours)
- Maria Lopez (full dialogue)
- Phantom (full dialogue)

**Session 3: Priority 2 Characters** (Estimated: 12-15 hours)
- Yamada, Rosa, Delilah (full dialogue)

**Session 4: Priority 2-3 Characters** (Estimated: 10-12 hours)
- Jax, Saint Mariah, Jin, Marcus Webb (full dialogue)

**Session 5: Priority 3-4 & Pickups** (Estimated: 8-10 hours)
- Remaining characters, retakes, alternate takes

**Total Estimated Studio Time**: 57-72 hours

### Per-Session Preparation

Each actor should receive:
1. **Character Profile** (1-2 pages)
2. **Full Script** (their dialogue with context)
3. **Iconic Lines List** (priority recording)
4. **Character Arc Overview** (how they evolve)
5. **Reference Audio** (if desired tone/style examples exist)

### Direction Notes Format

Each dialogue line in character scripts follows this format:

```
[CONTEXT: Location / Situation]
[EMOTION: Primary emotional state]
[DIRECTION: Specific acting notes]

"Dialogue line here."

[SUBTEXT: What character is really thinking/feeling]
[ALTERNATE TAKES: If multiple reads needed]
```

Example:
```
[CONTEXT: Tanaka's Clinic / Player asks about chrome degradation]
[EMOTION: Compassionate concern, professional expertise]
[DIRECTION: Warm but clinical, like doctor explaining diagnosis to patient they care about]

"Chrome degradation isn't just physical. It's neurological. Your brain stops recognizing parts of your body as 'you.' That's when dissociation starts."

[SUBTEXT: Tanaka has seen this destroy people, wants player to understand the danger]
[ALTERNATE TAKES: One take more clinical/detached, one more emotionally invested]
```

## Budget Estimation Framework

### Industry Standard Rates (2026)
- **Professional Union Voice Actor**: $200-500 per hour (studio session)
- **Non-Union Experienced**: $100-250 per hour
- **Indie/New Talent**: $50-150 per hour
- **Studio Rental**: $75-200 per hour (with engineer)
- **Post-Processing**: $50-100 per hour (editing, cleanup)

### Line Delivery Time
- **Average**: 4-6 lines per minute (including direction, retakes)
- **Complex Emotional**: 2-3 lines per minute
- **Simple/Barks**: 8-10 lines per minute

### Budget Ranges

**Low Budget** (Indie, new talent, minimal studio):
- ~5,000 total lines × 15 seconds average = 20.8 hours raw recording
- 20.8 hours recording × 1.5 (retakes/direction) = ~31 hours studio
- Talent: $100/hour × 31 hours = $3,100
- Studio: $100/hour × 31 hours = $3,100
- Post: $75/hour × 20 hours = $1,500
- **Total: ~$7,700**

**Mid Budget** (Experienced actors, professional studio):
- ~5,000 lines, same calculation
- Talent: $250/hour × 31 hours = $7,750
- Studio: $150/hour × 31 hours = $4,650
- Post: $100/hour × 25 hours = $2,500
- **Total: ~$14,900**

**High Budget** (Union actors, premium studio, multiple takes):
- ~5,000 lines, more takes/direction = 40 hours studio
- Talent: $400/hour × 40 hours = $16,000
- Studio: $200/hour × 40 hours = $8,000
- Post: $100/hour × 30 hours = $3,000
- **Total: ~$27,000**

### Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Prioritize Critical Characters**: Record Priority 1 first with budget, use AI/stock for Priority 4
2. **Remote Recording**: Actors record from home studios (reduces studio costs 50-70%)
3. **Bundle Sessions**: Book actors for full days (often cheaper than hourly)
4. **Indie Casting**: Find talented new actors (Casting Call Club, Voice Acting Club)
5. **Hybrid Approach**: Professional actors for Priority 1-2, AI/amateur for Priority 3-4

## File Naming Convention

Voice files should follow consistent naming:

```
[CharacterName]_[QuestID/Context]_[LineNumber]_[EmotionalTag].wav

Examples:
Tanaka_SQ_TANAKA_RESEARCH_001_Compassionate.wav
Okonkwo_SQ_OKONKWO_TEST_045_Philosophical.wav
Lopez_SQ_UNION_ORGANIZING_112_Angry.wav
```

### Emotional Tags
- Neutral (default)
- Compassionate
- Angry
- Sad
- Excited
- Philosophical
- Cynical
- Desperate
- Triumphant
- Defeated

## Localization Considerations

If translating to other languages:
- Character personalities remain consistent across languages
- Cultural references may need adaptation (not direct translation)
- Voice direction notes apply to all languages
- Some characters' accents/speech patterns don't translate (e.g., Okonkwo's West African cadence)

**Estimated Additional Cost per Language**: 60-80% of original voice acting budget

## Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing recordings:
- [ ] All Priority 1 characters fully recorded
- [ ] Iconic lines recorded with multiple takes
- [ ] Emotional range demonstrated (each character has variety)
- [ ] Audio quality consistent (no volume/tone mismatches)
- [ ] Pronunciation consistent (character says "chrome" the same way throughout)
- [ ] Character arc progression audible (character sounds different early vs late game)
- [ ] Backup takes recorded for critical moments
- [ ] All files properly named and organized
- [ ] Master recordings archived (before post-processing)

## Special Considerations

### AI Fragment 7
- **Synthetic voice with human warmth**: Not robotic, but subtly artificial
- **60 years of isolation**: Voice should feel "old" (not aged, but ancient data)
- **Loneliness**: Emotional vulnerability despite being AI
- **Recommendation**: Process human actor's voice with subtle vocoder/synthesizer

### The Flesh / Chrome / Balance (Abstract Internal Voices)
- **Same voice as player character**: These are player's internal aspects
- **Differentiated by processing**: Flesh (organic reverb), Chrome (digital echo), Balance (neutral)
- **Philosophical depth**: Not casual dialogue, requires thoughtful delivery
- **Recommendation**: Record after player voice is cast

### News Anchors / Automated Systems
- **Can use text-to-speech**: Appropriate for world (corpo media is automated)
- **Professional TTS services**: More natural than free options
- **Alternative**: Single voice actor records all news/systems (cheaper than multiple)

## Character Voice Type Recommendations
