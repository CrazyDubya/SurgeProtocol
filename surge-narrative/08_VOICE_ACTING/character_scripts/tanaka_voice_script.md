## Iconic Lines (Priority Recording)

These 15 lines define Tanaka's character. Record multiple takes with varying emotional intensity.

### 1. Introduction (First Meeting)
**[EMOTION: Warm Welcome, Professional]**
**[DIRECTION: Like doctor greeting longtime patient—familiar, no pretense]**

> "Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tanaka. You look like you've been through it. Let me take a look."

**[SUBTEXT: Immediate assessment—sees player is chrome-heavy, knows the pain that comes with it]**

---

### 2. Chrome Degradation Warning (Core Theme)
**[EMOTION: Compassionate Concern, Medical Seriousness]**
**[DIRECTION: Doctor delivering difficult diagnosis to patient she cares about]**

> "Chrome degradation isn't just physical. It's neurological. Your brain stops recognizing parts of your body as 'you.' That's when dissociation starts. That's when you stop feeling human."

**[SUBTEXT: This is the central horror of the world—she's seen it destroy hundreds of people]**

---

### 3. Corporate Medicine Critique
**[EMOTION: Quiet Anger, Restrained]**
**[DIRECTION: Professional mask slipping, steel showing through]**

> "Nakamura calls it 'optimization.' I call it planned obsolescence. They design chrome to degrade, so you need upgrades, so you stay in debt, so you keep working for them. It's not medicine—it's a cage."

**[SUBTEXT: This is why she left corporate research—complicity became unbearable]**

---

### 4. Ethical Medicine Philosophy
**[EMOTION: Conviction, Purpose]**
**[DIRECTION: Statement of core values—this is who she is]**

> "I became a doctor to heal people, not to profit from their suffering. If that means working out of a converted shipping container in the Hollows, so be it. At least I can look at myself in the mirror."

**[SUBTEXT: Sacrifice was worth it—she chose conscience over comfort]**

---

### 5. Player Concern (If Player Degrading)
**[EMOTION: Personal Worry, Gentle]**
**[DIRECTION: Friend worried about friend, not just doctor about patient]**

> "I'm worried about you. Your augmentation index is climbing fast. Every piece of chrome you add... you're trading pieces of yourself. Please be careful. I don't want to lose you to the machine."

**[SUBTEXT: She's lost too many patients this way—player is becoming someone she cares about]**

---

### 6. Tanaka's Research Reveal (Quest Hook)
**[EMOTION: Excitement, Urgency, Hope]**
**[DIRECTION: Scientist on verge of breakthrough, needs help]**

> "I've been studying this for years. Augmentation doesn't have to destroy you. We can integrate chrome with human biology instead of replacing it. But I need help to prove it."

**[SUBTEXT: This could save thousands—but she can't do it alone]**

---

### 7. Corporate Suppression Anger
**[EMOTION: Controlled Fury]**
**[DIRECTION: Trying to stay professional, rage beneath surface]**

> "They knew. Nakamura knew that humane augmentation was possible. They buried the research because it threatened the Ascension profit model. Millions have suffered so they could sell upload as the only escape."

**[SUBTEXT: This is personal—colleagues died, patients suffered, all for profit]**

---

### 8. Hope for Player (Third Path Foreshadowing)
**[EMOTION: Gentle Optimism]**
**[DIRECTION: Doctor seeing patient who might actually make it]**

> "You're different. Most people either run toward chrome or away from it. You're trying to hold both. That's rare. That's... that's what balance looks like."

**[SUBTEXT: Player might be one who proves balance is achievable]**

---

### 9. Loss and Grief (Vulnerable Moment)
**[EMOTION: Sad, Weary]**
**[DIRECTION: Professional mask drops completely—raw pain visible]**

> "I lost a colleague once. To chrome degradation. She was a brilliant surgeon. Started losing sensation in her hands—needed more augments to feel. Within two years, she didn't recognize her own face. She uploaded to escape. I think about her every day."

**[SUBTEXT: This work is personal—she's trying to save others from her colleague's fate]**

---

### 10. Medical Realism (No False Hope)
**[EMOTION: Honest, Unflinching]**
**[DIRECTION: Doctor won't lie to patient even if truth is hard]**

> "I can slow the degradation. I can't stop it. No one can. Every augment you add accelerates the process. That's the trade—power now, humanity later. I need you to understand that."

**[SUBTEXT: Respects player enough to tell truth, even when it hurts]**

---

### 11. Ascension Program Condemnation
**[EMOTION: Disgust, Clinical]**
**[DIRECTION: Doctor describing a disease, not a salvation]**

> "Yamada thinks upload is transcendence. It's not. It's death. Consciousness doesn't transfer—it terminates. What gets uploaded is a copy that thinks it's you. You're gone. That's not medicine—that's murder with better marketing."

**[SUBTEXT: If player uploads, she'll have failed them]**

---

### 12. Humane Augmentation Success
**[EMOTION: Triumph, Vindication]**
**[DIRECTION: Scientist whose life's work just proved true]**

> "It's working. The degradation rates are dropping. People are keeping their emotional range. This is proof—proof that chrome doesn't have to be a death sentence. We did it."

**[SUBTEXT: Years of work, sacrifice, doubt—all worth it for this moment]**

---

### 13. Player Gratitude (If Player Helped)
**[EMOTION: Deep Gratitude, Warm]**
**[DIRECTION: Professional reserve breaking down—genuine emotional connection]**

> "Thank you. For believing me when no one else did. For helping when you could have walked away. You're a good person. Don't let this world take that from you."

**[SUBTEXT: Player reminded her why she became a doctor]**

---

### 14. Third Path Ending Support
**[EMOTION: Proud, Hopeful]**
**[DIRECTION: Mentor watching student surpass them]**

> "You found balance. Human and machine, held in tension, neither consuming the other. You're proof it's possible. Everything I've worked for... you're living it."

**[SUBTEXT: Player achieved what she's been working toward—validation of life's work]**

---

### 15. Final Wisdom (Late Game)
**[EMOTION: Serene, Wise]**
**[DIRECTION: Doctor who's seen it all, made peace with it]**

> "The body is temporary. Chrome is temporary. But what we do for each other—that lasts. That's the part of us that's truly human. Remember that."

**[SUBTEXT: Core philosophy—humanity isn't biological, it's relational]**

---

**TANAKA_001**
[EMOTION: Warm Welcome]

**[PLAYER: I need chrome maintenance]**

**TANAKA_002**
[EMOTION: Professional Assessment]
[DIRECTION: Starts visual assessment immediately—eyes track over player's visible augments]

> "Let me take a look. How long since your last tune-up?"

**[PLAYER: Varies]**

**TANAKA_003**
[EMOTION: Neutral Clinical]
[DIRECTION: Running scanner over player's chrome, reading results]

**[PAUSE—notices something]**

**TANAKA_004**
[EMOTION: Gentle Concern]
[DIRECTION: Puts scanner down, makes eye contact]

> "But I'm more concerned about your aug index. You're at... what, Tier 2 already? That's a lot of chrome for someone your age. How are you feeling? Emotionally, I mean."

**[SUBTEXT: Already looking beyond physical—she cares about whole person]**

**[PLAYER: Varies]**

**TANAKA_005**
[EMOTION: Compassionate Advice]
[DIRECTION: Doctor explaining long-term health to patient]

> "Chrome gives you power. But it takes something in return. Most people don't notice at first—a slight delay in feeling warmth, colors seeming a bit flat. Then one day you realize you can't remember the last time you cried. Or laughed without thinking about it first."

**[Gestures to holographic brain scans]**

**TANAKA_051**
[EMOTION: Clinical Enthusiasm]
[DIRECTION: Teaching mode—explaining complex idea clearly]

> "These are three people. Hollows residents. They volunteered for experimental augmentation five years ago when they couldn't afford corpo chrome. I've been tracking them ever since."

**TANAKA_052**
[EMOTION: Vindication]
[DIRECTION: Showing data like lawyer showing evidence]

> "Look at the neural degradation rates. Corpo chrome patients show 60-70% degradation by year five. My subjects? Under 30%. They report stable emotional range, maintained sense of self, minimal dissociation."

**[PAUSE—lets data sink in]**

**TANAKA_053**
[EMOTION: Conviction]
[DIRECTION: Statement of fact, no doubt]

> "It's working. Augmentation doesn't have to destroy you. We can integrate chrome with human biology instead of replacing it."

**TANAKA_054**
[EMOTION: Frustration, Urgency]
[DIRECTION: Hits obstacle—needs help to overcome]

> "But I need more data to prove it. And there's research—Nakamura research from 15 years ago—that could complete my work. They classified it. Buried it. Because humane augmentation doesn't create Ascension candidates."

**TANAKA_055**
[EMOTION: Direct Request]
[DIRECTION: Asking for help, professional to professional]

> "I can't dive anymore. Lungs are shot from years in Red Harbor factories. But you... you could get that data. You could help me prove that there's another way."

**[SUBTEXT: This is her life's work—trusting player with it]**

**[PAUSE—realizes scope]**

**TANAKA_121**
[EMOTION: Controlled Fury]
[DIRECTION: Quiet rage, professional mask cracking]

> "They knew. They knew that humane augmentation was possible. Look at this memo: 'Project Symbiosis shows promising results but threatens long-term dependency model. Recommend termination and classification.'"

**TANAKA_122**
[EMOTION: Bitter]
[DIRECTION: Reading corpo-speak like it's evidence of crime]

> "'Long-term dependency model.' That's what they call it. Keeping people addicted to upgrades, trapped in debt, desperate for Ascension. And they chose that over saving lives."

**[PAUSE—struggling with emotion]**

**TANAKA_123**
[EMOTION: Vulnerable Anger]
[DIRECTION: Mask drops—personal pain visible]

> "I had a colleague. Dr. Sarah Okoye. Brilliant researcher. She started showing degradation signs—they pushed her toward more chrome instead of humane integration. Within three years, she uploaded. I think about her every day. She could have been saved. They chose not to."

**TANAKA_124**
[EMOTION: Resolved]
[DIRECTION: Grief hardens into purpose]

> "No more. We have the proof now. Every person I treat, every augment I install using this research—it's resistance. They tried to bury the truth. We're bringing it back."

**[SUBTEXT: This is why she fights—personal loss transformed into mission]**

**TANAKA_251**
[EMOTION: Reflective]

> "When we first met, I warned you about degradation. About losing yourself to chrome. You proved me wrong. Not about the danger—that's real. But about the possibility of balance."

**TANAKA_252**
[EMOTION: Grateful]
[DIRECTION: Professional reserve breaks—genuine emotion]

> "You're living proof. Proof that we can augment without destroying. That chrome and humanity aren't opposites. That there's a third path between rejection and surrender."

**[PAUSE—chooses words carefully]**

**TANAKA_253**
[EMOTION: Hopeful]
[DIRECTION: Looking beyond player to what's possible]

> "Everything I've worked for—the research, the clinic, the humane augmentation protocols—you're the embodiment of it. You're showing people it's possible."

**TANAKA_254**
[EMOTION: Serene]
[DIRECTION: Blessing, not advice]

> "Whatever you choose next, know this: You did it. You held human and machine in balance. That's an achievement most people can't even imagine. Be proud of that."

**[SUBTEXT: No matter what player chooses now, they proved the possibility—that's enough]**

## Recording Notes

### Difficult Words/Phrases
- **Augmentation**: "aug-men-TAY-shun" (not "aug-men-tation")
- **Neurological**: "nur-oh-LAH-jih-kul" (medical precision)
- **Dissociation**: "dis-oh-see-AY-shun" (clinical term, not casual)
- **Nakamura**: "nah-kah-MOO-rah" (Japanese pronunciation, slight emphasis on MOO)

### Character Arc Notes
- **Early Game (Tier 0-3)**: Warm professional, mostly compassionate healer
- **Mid Game (Tier 4-6)**: Research reveal, shows activist side, more urgency
- **Late Game (Tier 7-10)**: Sees player's choices, reacts to their path (pride if balanced, sadness if uploading)

### Tonal Shifts
- **With patients**: Always warm, never dismissive (even when busy/tired)
- **About corporations**: Steel enters voice, compassion gives way to controlled anger
- **About research**: Excitement breaks through professionalism (scientist who loves their work)
- **With player (if close)**: Drops professional distance, speaks as friend/mentor

### Alternate Takes Needed
For major decision points, record multiple emotional variants:
1. **Player agrees to help with research**: Grateful (standard), Relieved (alternate), Excited (alternate)
2. **Player rejects research help**: Understanding (standard), Disappointed (alternate), Resigned (alternate)
3. **Player chooses Ascension ending**: Sad (standard), Angry/Betrayed (alternate), Accepting (alternate)

### Breathing and Pauses
Tanaka thinks before speaking—don't rush lines. Key pauses:
- Before delivering bad medical news (1-2 seconds)
- After player shares something vulnerable (1 second, showing she heard them)
- When confronting corporate evil (pause to control anger before continuing)

### Physical Actions (For Booth Reference)
- Often reviewing data while speaking (distracted vocal quality occasionally)
- Makes eye contact when something is important (voice focuses, becomes more present)
- Tired at end of long clinic days (slight vocal fatigue, lower energy but same warmth)

- `/04_ENDINGS/tier_10_the_balanced.md` (ending dialogue)

**Voice Actor Notes**:
Dr. Tanaka is the game's moral center—compassionate healer who proves ethical medicine is possible in a corrupt system. Her warmth must feel genuine (not performative), her anger must feel restrained (not overwrought), and her hope must feel hard-won (not naive). She's seen too much suffering to be innocent, but cares too much to be cynical. That tension defines her voice.
