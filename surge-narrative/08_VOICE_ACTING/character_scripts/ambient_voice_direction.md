- Location appropriateness (district, setting)
- Time sensitivity (time of day, story progress)
- Story flag checks (player choices, completed quests)

### Rotation System

- Lines should rotate to avoid repetition
- Higher-tier lines replace lower-tier equivalents

### Combination Rules

- Location-specific + tier-specific can combine
- News + rumors should not play simultaneously
- Vendor lines appropriate to vendor type only
