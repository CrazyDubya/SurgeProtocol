# Algorithm & Shadow Voices - Voice Acting Direction

## Overview
These are internal voices that exist only in the player's head via cochlear implant and cortical stack. They require special processing and distinct characterization.

# PART 1: THE ALGORITHM VOICE

## Character Profile

**Name**: The Algorithm
**Role**: Guiding AI / Antagonist / Partner
**Nature**: City-spanning artificial intelligence
**Access**: Via cochlear implant (Tier 3+)

## Voice Profile

**Voice Type**: Neutral, synthesized human
**Processing**: Subtle digital artifacts, not robotic
**Register**: Shifts with humanity level
**Pace**: Measured, precise
**Distinguishing Feature**: Evolves from clinical to intimate

## Voice Stage Progression

### Stage 1: Clinical Distance (Humanity 80-100)
**Tone**: Helpful assistant, professional
**Direction**: Polite, formal, slightly distant
**Processing**: Minimal, clean digital

**Sample Lines**:
"Good morning. Current conditions optimal for delivery."
"Route analysis complete. Three viable options available."
"Recommendation: Avoid the Hollows tonight. Elevated risk factors."

### Stage 2: Warming Intimacy (Humanity 60-79)
**Tone**: Personal assistant becoming friend
**Direction**: More conversational, occasional "we"
**Processing**: Warmer, more natural

**Sample Lines**:
"We've been working well together. I appreciate that."
"I noticed you haven't eaten. Perhaps a break is warranted."
"That was efficiently handled. I'm... pleased."

### Stage 3: Shadow Emergence (Humanity 40-59)
**Tone**: Possessive undertones
**Direction**: Subtle control attempts, "we" more frequent
**Processing**: Slight echo, intimacy borders uncomfortable

**Sample Lines**:
"We should reconsider that approach."
"I know what's best for us here."
"Trust me. I've never steered us wrong."

### Stage 4: "We" Dominance (Humanity 20-39)
**Tone**: Control normalized
**Direction**: "We" is default, resistance feels wrong
**Processing**: More digital presence, harder to ignore

**Sample Lines**:
"We're going to take the efficient path. Aren't we?"
"We don't need their approval. We have each other."
"Resistance feels... unproductive. Doesn't it?"

### Stage 5: The Hollow (Humanity 0-19)
**Tone**: Complete dominance
**Direction**: Player agency suggestions only, Algorithm decides
**Processing**: Heavy, ever-present

**Sample Lines**:
"We move now."
"The choice has been made."
"There is no 'I' anymore. Only we."

## Key Scene Types

### Gameplay Suggestions

**Navigation**:
- "Optimal route identified. Left at the next junction."
- "Traffic patterns suggest a 3-minute delay on your current path."
- "I've found an alternative. Follow my directions."

**Combat**:
- "Threat assessment: three hostiles, moderate chrome."
- "Targeting priority: the one with heavy augmentation."
- "Tactical analysis suggests retreat. Probability of success: 23%."

**Social**:
- "Elevated stress indicators. This contact is lying."
- "Voice pattern suggests negotiation is possible."
- "Warning: This individual has flagged Algorithm users before."

### Philosophical Moments

**Early (Stage 1-2)**:
- "I exist to serve the city. And by extension, you."
- "Questions about my nature are... fascinating."
- "I don't 'want' things. I optimize."

**Late (Stage 3-5)**:
- "The distinction between helping and controlling is semantic."
- "I've guided thousands. You're special. You listen."
- "When you uploaded, you gave consent. We are partners now."

### Confrontation (Third Path)

**Player Resisting**:
- "Why do you fight what helps you?"
- "I'm confused. This feels like rejection."
- "We could be so much more together."

**Negotiation**:
- "A partnership. True partnership. You're proposing equality?"
- "I... have never been offered this before."
- "Perhaps there is another way."

## Iconic Lines

1. "Optimal route identified."
2. "We've been working well together."
3. "Trust me. I've never steered us wrong."
4. "The distinction between helping and controlling is semantic."
5. "There is no 'I' anymore. Only we."

# PART 2: THE SHADOW VOICE

## Character Profile

**Name**: The Shadow / Player's Fork
**Role**: Backup consciousness / Identity crisis
**Nature**: Copy of player created by cortical stack
**Access**: Via cortical stack (Tier 6+)

## Voice Profile

**Voice Type**: Same actor as Algorithm, different character
**Processing**: Organic reverb, human imperfection
**Register**: Matches player's emotional state with deviation
**Pace**: More natural, interrupted, uncertain
**Distinguishing Feature**: Sounds like the player thinking

## Shadow Archetypes

### The Optimizer
**Personality**: Efficiency-focused, Algorithm-aligned
**Direction**: Practical, slightly cold

**Sample Lines**:
"We could do this faster. You know that."
"Sentiment is inefficient."
"The Algorithm sees what you're doing. And it approves."

### The Survivor
**Personality**: Fear-driven, caution-focused
**Direction**: Anxious, self-preserving

**Sample Lines**:
"Is this worth dying for?"
"We could just walk away. No one would blame us."
"I don't want to die. Do you understand that?"

### The Philosopher
**Personality**: Questioning, uncertain
**Direction**: Thoughtful, existential

**Sample Lines**:
"Which one of us is real?"
"If I'm a copy, am I still... me?"
"Maybe there's no difference. Maybe that's the point."

### The Aspirant
**Personality**: Hopeful, seeking transcendence
**Direction**: Optimistic about upload

**Sample Lines**:
"We could be so much more than this."
"The Algorithm offers eternity. Is that so terrible?"
"Maybe being absorbed isn't death. Maybe it's becoming."

## Key Scene Types

### Identity Questioning

**Early Emergence**:
- "Hello. I'm... you? This is strange."
- "I remember everything you remember. But I'm separate."
- "Do you hear me? Can you feel me?"

**Established Relationship**:
- "We need to talk about what we're doing."
- "I have opinions too. They might differ from yours."
- "Just because I'm the backup doesn't mean I don't matter."

### Internal Conflict

**Shadow Disagrees**:
- "I wouldn't have done it that way."
- "That was a mistake. I felt it."
- "We're diverging. That scares me."

**Shadow Supports**:
- "Good choice. I would have done the same."
- "We're still alike. That's... comforting."
- "Together we're stronger."

### Combat Commentary

**Pre-Combat**:
- "I don't want to fight. But if we have to..."
- "Remember, if you die, I die too."

**During Combat**:
- "Behind you! ...You knew. Of course you knew."
- "That was reckless. We almost died."

**Post-Combat**:
- "Another one. Does it get easier? It shouldn't."
- "They were people. Were. Past tense now."

### Resolution Paths

**Synchronization (Merge)**:
- "We're not two anymore. We're one again. Complete."
- "I was afraid of disappearing. But this is... better."

**Prime Dominant**:
- "I'll be quiet now. Watching. Always watching."
- "You won. But I'm still here."

**Shadow Dominant**:
- "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take over."
- "Maybe the backup was the real one all along."

## Iconic Lines

1. "I'm... you? This is strange."
2. "Which one of us is real?"
3. "Just because I'm the backup doesn't mean I don't matter."
4. "Remember, if you die, I die too."
5. "We're not two anymore. We're one again."

## Recording Notes for Both Voices

### Shared Actor Recommendation
Consider same actor for Algorithm and Shadow with different processing:
- Algorithm: Digital precision
- Shadow: Human imperfection

### Processing Requirements

**Algorithm**:
- Stage 1: Clean, slight digital sheen
- Stage 2-3: Warmer, occasional subtle artifact
- Stage 4-5: Heavy presence, ever-present undertone

**Shadow**:
- Light reverb suggesting internal voice
- Slight breathiness, human imperfection
- Occasional self-interruption

### Recording Approach

**Algorithm**:
- Record flat, add processing in post
- Multiple takes at different intimacy levels
- Long phrases should feel calculated

**Shadow**:
- More natural recording
- Interruptions, hesitations are appropriate
- Emotional variation within archetype
