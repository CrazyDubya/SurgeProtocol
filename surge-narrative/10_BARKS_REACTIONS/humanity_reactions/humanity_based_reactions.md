# Humanity Reaction Barks

## Overview
These lines play when NPCs react to the player's visible humanity level (chrome amount, behavior patterns, Algorithm integration signs).

## High Humanity (80-100): Comfortable, Human

### Positive Reactions
**Context**: NPCs feel at ease with a mostly-human courier

**Variant 1**
"Nice to see someone who hasn't gone full chrome. Refreshing."

**Variant 2**
"You're one of the real ones, aren't you? Still got your eyes."
[VOICE: Approving, checking player's face]

**Variant 3**
"My kid wants to be a courier. Seeing you... maybe it's not all bad."

[VOICE: Noticing something precious]

### Trust Reactions
**Context**: NPCs more willing to open up

**Variant 1**

### Questioning Reactions
**Context**: NPCs wondering about the cost

**Variant 1**

## Special Contextual Reactions

"I saw what you did. How do you live with yourself?"

## Implementation Notes

### Visual Cues for NPCs
NPCs should have appropriate body language:
- High humanity: Normal, relaxed
- Medium: Slightly tense, occasional glances
- Low: Maintaining distance, watching hands
- Critical: Fight-or-flight posture

### Algorithm Believer Frequency
- 5-10% of NPCs in Hollows worship Algorithm
- 20-30% in Uptown
- 0% in Interstitial
- These NPCs react positively to low humanity

### Trigger Timing
- Reaction plays when player enters NPC awareness range
- Some reactions are instantaneous (fear), some delayed (philosophical)
- Never interrupt NPC conversations—queue for after
