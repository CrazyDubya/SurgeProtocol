## ALGORITHM INTEGRATION REACTIONS (20 Lines)

### If Player Integrated

**1. Positive Street Reaction**
"You integrated? [Impressed] Smart move. Opens doors, you know? Better jobs, better connections."

**2. Neutral Observation**
"[Noticing Algorithm indicators] Ah, you joined the connected. [Shrug] Most do eventually."

**3. Concerned Comment**
"I heard you integrated. [Worried] Just... stay you, alright? I've seen people change after."

**4. Resistance Disappointment**
"[Cold] You joined them. [Turning away] I thought you were different."

**5. Convergence Welcome**
"[Warm] A new sibling in the collective. [Touching heart] Welcome to connection."

**6. Courier Peer Assessment**
"Algorithm-enhanced now? [Calculating] That explains the faster times. Fair advantage, I guess."

**7. Elder's Observation**
"[Old person, sad] Another one lost to the machine. [Philosophical] Or found, depending on your view."

**8. Doctor's Comment**
"I see integration in your scans. [Clinical] Any side effects? Mood changes? Identity concerns? Report anything unusual."

**9. Vendor Adjustment**
"[Checking Algorithm compatibility] Good—you can use the premium interfaces now. [Showing products] These become available."

**10. Random Street**
"[Noticing] You've got that look now. The Algorithm look. [Unsure] Hope it's what you wanted."

### If Player Refused Integration

**11. Resistance Approval**
"[Respectful nod] You stayed baseline. [Appreciative] Rare. Harder path, but meaningful."

**12. Convergence Disappointment**
"[Sad] You could have had peace. [Gentle] The offer remains. When you're ready."

**13. Practical Concern**
"No Algorithm? [Calculating] That limits your ceiling. Tier 5, maybe 6 max. Worth it to you?"

**14. Admiration**
"[Impressed] Running baseline in an Algorithm world? [Respect] That takes conviction."

**15. Confusion**
"Wait, you're not integrated? [Surprised] How are you competing at this tier without—never mind. Clearly you manage."

**16. Elder's Approval**
"[Old person, pleased] Someone remembers what it means to be simply human. [Nostalgic] Good. Good."

**17. Courier Peer Doubt**
"Baseline against Algorithm-enhanced? [Skeptical] You're either crazy or legendary. Maybe both."

**18. Vendor Limitation**
"[Checking compatibility] Oh, unintegrated. [Apologetic] Some of my inventory won't interface with you. Limited options."

**19. Street Philosophy**
"[To friend, about player] That one refused the Algorithm. [Debating] Principle or stupidity? Can never tell."

**20. Medical Observation**
"Pure baseline at this tier is unusual. [Interested] Your neurology must be exceptional. Have you considered research participation?"

## FACTION ALIGNMENT REACTIONS (20 Lines)

### Convergence Alignment

**21. Convergence Recognition**
"[Fellow Convergence member] The Algorithm sings in you. [Peaceful] Together we ascend."

**22. Resistance Wariness**
"[Careful] You're with Convergence. [Guarded] We can still work together, but... watch what you share."

**23. Neutral Observation**
"[Merchant] Convergence supporter? [Shrugging] Credits are credits. I serve all customers."

**24. Street Reaction**
"That one's with the merge crowd. [Uncertain] They seem peaceful, but... giving up your self? Creepy."

### Resistance Alignment

**25. Resistance Solidarity**
"[Fellow resistance member] Staying human, staying free. [Fist bump] The fight continues."

**26. Convergence Sadness**
"[Gentle] You've chosen fear over peace. [Compassionate] We'll welcome you when you're ready."

**27. Neutral Assessment**
"[Merchant] Resistance supporter? [Practical] Your money's good. Just don't bring trouble here."

**28. Street Reaction**
"That courier's against the Convergence. [Mixed] Brave or paranoid? Hard to say which."

### Neutral/Unaligned

**29. Both Factions Recruiting**
"You haven't picked a side? [Impressed and worried] Both will try harder to recruit you. Watch yourself."

**30. Practical Observation**
"No faction affiliation? [Calculating] That means you can work for anyone. Valuable position."

**31. Philosophical Comment**
"Staying neutral in this fight? [Thoughtful] Either wise or impossible. Time will tell which."

### Faction Shift Reactions

**32. Betrayal Recognition**
"[Hostile] You switched sides. [Bitter] I remember when you were with us. Can't trust turncoats."

**33. Defection Welcome**
"[Cautious welcome] You left them for us. [Testing] Why the change? What did you see?"

**34. Neutral on Change**

## FORK DECISION REACTIONS (20 Lines)

### If Player Forked

**35. Curious Question**
"You have a fork out there? [Fascinated] What's that like? Knowing another you exists?"

**36. Practical Interest**
"A fork. [Calculating] Double the contacts, double the work capacity. Smart business move."

**37. Philosophical Concern**
"Your fork... do they know they're the copy? [Uncomfortable] Or do they think they're the original? Does it matter?"

**38. Jealousy**
"[Envious] I can't afford to fork. [Bitter] Must be nice, duplicating yourself. Rest of us struggle with one life."

**39. Horror Story Reference**
"You forked? [Warning] I knew someone who forked. The relationship went badly. Really badly. Be careful."

**40. Convergence View**
"A fork. [Pleased] Two of you means twice the potential for unity. Both welcome to the collective."

**41. Family Concern**
"Your fork... are they family now? [Confused] Like a sibling you share memories with? I can't wrap my head around it."

**42. Legal Question**
"If your fork commits a crime, are you liable? [Curious] The law's still figuring this out."

**43. Identity Check**
"[Squinting] Are you the original or the fork? [Pause] Does asking that question offend you? I genuinely can't tell."

**44. Relationship Status**
"Your partner... are they with you or your fork? [Awkward] Sorry, none of my business. Just curious."

### If Player Refused Fork

**45. Understanding**
"No fork? [Nodding] I wouldn't either. One of me is complicated enough."

**46. Disappointment (Corporate)**
"You declined our fork program? [Cold] A missed opportunity. The offer won't remain open forever."

**47. Relief (Friend)**
"[Relieved] I'm glad you didn't fork. [Honest] I don't know if I could handle two of you."
