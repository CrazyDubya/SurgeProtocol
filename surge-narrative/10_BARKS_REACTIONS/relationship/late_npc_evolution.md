# Late NPC Relationship Evolution

## Purpose
60 dialogue variations showing how Tier 4-8 NPCs change their behavior as relationships evolve. Higher-tier NPCs have more guarded initial stages and more significant trust payoffs.

---

## RELATIONSHIP STAGES (Higher Tier)

| Stage | Threshold | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Professional | 0-3 | Strict business, information control |
| Respected | 4-6 | Acknowledgment of capability |
| Trusted | 7-10 | Real talk, sensitive information |
| Inner Circle | 11+ | Full access, major revelations |

*Higher-tier NPCs are harder to advance with—actions matter more*

### Dialogue Priority
Inner circle dialogue takes priority in all contexts.
Relationship lines should feel earned at higher stages.
