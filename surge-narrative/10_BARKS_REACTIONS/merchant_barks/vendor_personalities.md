"Running low on nav units—shipment's delayed. [Apologetic] But I've got alternatives! Always got alternatives!"

### Madam Kozlov (Premium)

**4. Idle Presence**
"[Checking inventory on private display] Some items are not for browsing. They're for those who understand their value."

**14. Suspicious Question**
"Why do you need this, specifically? [Studying reaction] Not judging. Just... curious about your circumstances."

### Old Henrik (Vintage)
