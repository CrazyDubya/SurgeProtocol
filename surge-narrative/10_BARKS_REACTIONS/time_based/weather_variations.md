## RAIN DIALOGUE (12 Lines)

### Street NPCs
1. **Commuter**: "Rain again. At least it washes some of the grime away. Briefly."
2. **Vendor Covering Stock**: "Hurry up and buy! I'm not made of waterproof!"
3. **Philosophic Local**: "The Algorithm predicted 60% chance. Feels like 100% to me."
4. **Child with Parent**: "Mom, is rain good for chrome?" / "Ask your father. He's the integrated one."

### Couriers
5. **Wet Runner**: "Rain runs. Packages get wet, couriers get wet, everyone's unhappy."
6. **Experienced**: "Rain means fewer couriers working. More jobs for those of us willing to get wet."
7. **Chrome Concern**: "Rain's getting into my seals. Need maintenance after this run."

### Atmosphere
8. **Observation**: *Rain drums on chrome and flesh alike. The city's neon reflects in puddles, fragmenting.*
9. **Harbor in Rain**: "Dock work continues. Rain or shine. Union got that in the contract."
10. **Hollows Rain**: "Rain in the Hollows means flooding in the tunnels. Stick to surface routes."

### Opportunities
11. **Black Market**: "Rain keeps security indoors. Good time for off-the-books work."
12. **Shelter Seeking**: "Bar's crowded. Everyone waiting out the rain. Good for gossip."

## STORM DIALOGUE (10 Lines)

### Street NPCs
1. **Worried Resident**: "Storm warnings. The Algorithm's advising shelter. For once, I'm listening."
2. **Defiant**: "A little lightning never killed—well, actually. Maybe I'll head inside."
3. **Storm Watcher**: "Beautiful, in a terrifying way. Nature reminding us it's still here."

### Couriers
4. **Hazard Pay**: "Storm runs pay triple. Worth risking the lightning? Ask me after I survive."
5. **Delayed Runner**: "No deliveries until this passes. Even couriers have limits."
6. **Chrome Malfunction**: "Electrical interference. My targeting's off. Combat would be bad right now."

### Atmosphere
7. **Power Concerns**: "Storms this big knock out power. Backup generators only last so long."
8. **Harbor Storm**: "Ships pulling back to harbor. Storm surge coming. Bad night for the docks."
9. **Observation**: *Lightning illuminates the city in frozen frames. Thunder shakes windows.*
10. **Aftermath Preview**: "Storm damage means cleanup jobs tomorrow. And probably some memorial runs."

## FOG DIALOGUE (10 Lines)

### Street NPCs
1. **Nervous**: "Can't see ten feet ahead. Anything could be in this fog."
2. **Superstitious**: "Fog like this, the old-timers say the Interstitial bleeds through."
3. **Practical**: "Good fog for not being seen. Bad fog for seeing threats."

### Couriers
4. **Navigation Challenge**: "Fog means relying on chrome navigation. Hope the calibration holds."
5. **Stealth Opportunity**: "Fog runs are great for avoiding checkpoints. If you don't get lost."
6. **Courier Warning**: "Stay visible. We've had couriers hit on days like this."

### Atmosphere
7. **Observation**: *The fog swallows the city's geometry. Buildings emerge and vanish. Reality feels negotiable.*
8. **Hollows Fog**: "Fog in the Hollows is different. Thicker. Holds sounds strangely."
9. **Harbor Fog**: "Fog horns from the harbor. Ships moving blind. Praying, probably."
10. **Mystery**: "Someone—something—moved through the fog ahead. Gone when I looked closer."

## HEAT WAVE DIALOGUE (10 Lines)

### Street NPCs
1. **Overheating**: "This heat. My chrome's running emergency cooling. Feels like I'm dying."
2. **Vendor**: "Everything's melting. Ice, patience, will to live. Same prices though."
3. **Shade Competition**: "Every patch of shadow has someone in it. Territorial about shade now."
4. **Violence Warning**: "Heat makes people crazy. Three fights on my block last night."

### Couriers
5. **Heat Runner**: "Heat runs are brutal. Chrome overheats. Flesh overheats. Nobody wins."
6. **Hydration**: "Water stops are mandatory today. Dehydration doesn't care about deadlines."
7. **Timing Strategy**: "Run early morning, rest afternoon, run evening. Only way to survive heat season."

### Atmosphere
8. **Observation**: *Heat shimmers off every surface. The city sweats. Tempers crystallize.*
9. **Power Grid**: "Heat waves strain the grid. Brownouts expected. Chrome users prepare."
10. **Night Hope**: "Waiting for sunset. Nights are better. Not cool, but better."

---

## COLD SNAP DIALOGUE (8 Lines)

### Street NPCs
1. **Shivering**: "This cold isn't natural. Something's wrong with the weather systems."
2. **Baseline Suffering**: "Chrome regulates temperature. Those of us still organic? We suffer."
3. **Helping Others**: "The homeless freeze on nights like this. Shelters are full."

### Couriers
4. **Cold Runner**: "Cold runs hurt. Fingers don't work right. Reactions slow."
5. **Chrome Advantage**: "Temperature regulation chrome. Best purchase I ever made. Days like this prove it."

### Atmosphere
6. **Observation**: *The city crackles. Frost on chrome. Breath visible. Even the Algorithm seems to shiver.*
7. **Harbor Cold**: "Ice on the docks. Workers sliding. Accidents waiting to happen."
8. **Rare Event**: "They say cold snaps are rarer now. Climate stabilization. When they hit, we're not ready."

- Weather + Time = Combined atmospheric line (preferred)
- Weather overrides time for intensity (storm > morning)
- Story flags override all (specific event weather)

### Voice Direction
- Rain: Resigned, practical, wet
- Storm: Urgent, worried, dramatic
- Fog: Mysterious, cautious, unsettled
- Heat: Irritated, slow, exhausted
- Cold: Shivering, bitter, surprised

### Regional Weather
- Weather can affect different districts differently
- Harbor often foggier
