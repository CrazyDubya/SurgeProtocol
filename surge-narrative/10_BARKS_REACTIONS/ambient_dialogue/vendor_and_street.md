### Location Triggers

- Time of day affects which lines play
- Weather conditions trigger appropriate reactions

### Player Reputation Effects
- High-tier players hear more respectful vendor calls
- Low humanity triggers fearful reactions from some vendors
- Faction reputation affects faction-specific vendor behavior
