## TIER 0-2 REACTIONS: NEW COURIER (20 Lines)

*NPCs see a rookie—dismissive, condescending, occasionally helpful*

### Street Vendors

**1.** "[Barely glances up] Another rookie. Yeah, yeah, service entrance is around back. Don't block paying customers."

**2.** "[Dismissive wave] Tier what? Doesn't matter. Low-tier couriers get yesterday's bread. Take it or leave it."

**3.** "[Slight sympathy] New to this? [Softer] The good food cart's two blocks north. Tell them Manny sent you. They'll treat you decent."

### Other Couriers

**4.** "[Looks through player] Run along, newbie. Real couriers are working here."

**5.** "[Evaluating look] Fresh face. [Shrugs] Half of you wash out in three months. Prove you're the other half."

**6.** "[Competitive] Stay off my routes, Tier-nothing. I don't share clients with training wheels."

**7.** "[Surprisingly kind] First week? [Nods] Here's advice: Chen's fair. Rosa's honest. Trust nobody else until they've earned it."

### Shop Owners

**8.** "[Suspicious] You here to deliver or to case the place? Can't be too careful with low-tiers."

**9.** "[Bored] Courier, right? Package is there. Sign here. [No eye contact] Next."

**10.** "[Rosa-type] New boots already worn through? [Sighs] Come back tomorrow. I'll fix them cheap. Can't run on broken soles."

### Corporate Contacts

**11.** "[Through intercom] Tier level? [Pause] Use the service corridor. Don't touch anything."

**12.** "[Barely acknowledges] Delivery? Drop it there. [Already turning away] Security will process."

**13.** "[Cold] Your credentials check out. Barely. Don't expect to be invited upstairs."

### Underground Contacts

**14.** "[Wary] Who sent you? [Studies player] Too green for serious work. Take this easy job and don't screw up."

**15.** "[Testing] You want in? [Laughs] Come back when you've got scars. Real couriers earn their place."

### General Public

**16.** "[Parent pulling child away] Don't talk to couriers, honey. You don't know where they've been."

**17.** "[Drunk at bar] Courier? Buy your own drink. Nobody tips the messenger."

**18.** "[Worker on break] You'll be doing this forever, you know. Nobody tiers up from the bottom. [Bitter] Trust me."

**19.** "[Street kid] Nice chrome, mister. [Mocking] Just kidding. You got nothing."

**20.** "[Elder] I remember when couriers were respectable. [Disappointed glance] Not anymore, I guess."

### Underground Contacts
