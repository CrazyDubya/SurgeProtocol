## Relationship Progression

### Stage 1: Suspicious Contact (Relationship 0-25)
**Tier**: 3+
**Tone**: Wary, testing player's values

**First Meeting** (Red Harbor Union Hall):

*The union hall is crowded, workers sharing food and grievances. A woman at the front table looks up as you enter—not hostile, but evaluating.*

**Lopez**: "Courier. Don't see many of your kind in here. Most consider themselves too good for workers' meetings." [gestures to seat] "Sit if you want. We're discussing the Algorithm's new 'efficiency metrics.' Spoiler: they screw us all."

**Option A**: "I'm here to listen." [RESPECTFUL]
→ Lopez: "Listening is rare. Most people come to talk, or take, or sell something. Pull up a chair."
→ Relationship: +5

**Option B**: "What's this about?" [CURIOUS]
→ Lopez: "About workers. About how the Algorithm treats us as resources to be optimized. About fighting back." [studies player] "That interest you, or just passing through?"

**Option C**: "I'm looking for work." [TRANSACTIONAL]
→ Lopez: "Work? We don't hire—we organize. But if you want jobs that don't come through the Algorithm..." [considers] "Maybe we can help each other."

### Initial Test

**Lopez**: "We have a situation. Nakamura's rerouting delivery traffic through the Harbor—pushing out local couriers, undercutting prices. Some of us are organizing a slowdown." [eyes player] "Where do you stand?"

**Option A**: "I'll support the slowdown." [SOLIDARITY]
→ Lopez: "Good. You'll lose some credits this week. But you'll gain something more important—our trust."
→ Relationship: +10, minor income penalty

**Option B**: "I need to make a living too." [NEUTRAL]
→ Lopez: "Fair. We all do. Just remember—the Algorithm doesn't care about your living. Only your output."
→ No relationship change

**Option C**: "That's not my fight." [DISMISSIVE]
→ Lopez: "Everyone's fight is everyone's fight. You'll learn that when you're the one being pushed out."
→ Relationship: -10

---

### Stage 2: Tentative Ally (Relationship 26-50)
**Tier**: 4-5
**Tone**: Warming, sharing perspective

**Sample Dialogue**:

**Lopez**: "You know why the tier system exists? Not to reward excellence. To divide us. Tier 7 looks down on Tier 4. Tier 4 looks down on Tier 2. Meanwhile, who's looking up? Nakamura. Laughing all the way to their upload servers."

**You**: "You think the whole system is designed to control us?"

**Lopez**: "I don't think—I know. I've seen the memos. 'Courier competition reduces solidarity.' Direct quote. They want us racing against each other so we don't notice we're all running on the same wheel."

**Union Philosophy Discussion**:

**Lopez**: "The Algorithm calls us 'independent contractors.' Free agents. Self-directed entrepreneurs." [bitter laugh] "You know what that means in practice? No healthcare. No protections. No collective bargaining. Freedom to be exploited individually."

**Option A**: "What's the alternative?" [GENUINELY ASKING]
→ Lopez: "Organization. Solidarity. We work together, we negotiate together, we strike together if we have to. One courier says no, they're replaced. All couriers say no—"
→ Relationship: +5

**Option B**: "Some people like the independence." [CHALLENGING]
→ Lopez: "Some people like the *illusion* of independence. There's a difference. The Algorithm still controls the jobs, the routes, the pay. You're only free to choose which cage."

**Option C**: "I've done alright in the system." [PERSONAL]
→ Lopez: "So far. What happens when the Algorithm decides you're 'optimized'? When your tier drops because someone younger is faster? The system works until you're the one it's working against."

---

### Stage 3: Active Partnership (Relationship 51-75)
**Tier**: 5-6
**Tone**: Trust established, invites participation

**Union Mission: "Pressure Points"**

**Lopez**: "We've been tracking Nakamura's supply chains. There are... vulnerabilities. Not violence—we don't do that. But strategic delays, lost shipments, information that finds its way to competitors."

**You**: "Economic warfare."

**Lopez**: "Defense. They're crushing dock workers with automation. We're making automation expensive." [hands you data chip] "This is the schedule for their priority shipments. Imagine if those shipments... got complicated."

**Quest Options**:
1. Delay shipments (labor action) → Relationship: +10, Nakamura reputation: -5
2. Leak information to competitors → Relationship: +10, Ghost Network contact
3. Report to Nakamura → Relationship: -50, Lopez becomes hostile

**Personal History**:

**Lopez**: "My mother was a dock worker. Thirty years loading cargo. The Algorithm rated her obsolete at fifty-two. Just... discarded." [pause] "She uploaded a year later. Said she'd rather be useful as data than useless as meat."

**You**: "I'm sorry."

**Lopez**: "Don't be sorry. Be angry. Use that anger to build something better."

---

### Stage 4: Inner Circle (Relationship 76-90)
**Tier**: 6-7
**Tone**: Full trust, reveals secrets

**The Hidden Network**:

**Lopez** (private meeting): "I'm going to show you something. Only a few people know about this." [leads player to basement level] "We call it the Mutual Aid Network."

*The basement is a hub—medical supplies, food stores, communications equipment, and maps of corporate infrastructure.*

**Lopez**: "When the Algorithm cuts someone off, when their tier drops to nothing, when they can't afford chrome maintenance—they come here. We keep them alive. Keep them fighting."

**Option A**: "This is incredible." [AWED]
→ Lopez: "It's survival. The Algorithm wants us isolated, dependent, afraid. This is our answer—we take care of each other."
→ Relationship: +10

**Option B**: "How can I help?" [COMMITTED]
→ Lopez: "Run supplies. Carry messages. Use your courier skills for something that matters." [smiles] "Welcome to the real resistance."
→ Unlocks mutual aid missions

**Option C**: "Isn't this dangerous?" [CONCERNED]
→ Lopez: "Everything is dangerous. The question is what the danger is for. I'd rather risk my life for solidarity than safety for exploitation."

---

### Stage 5: Leadership Recognition (Relationship 91-100)
**Tier**: 7-9
**Tone**: Equal partnership, succession planning

**Lopez's Trust**:

**Lopez**: "I've been doing this for fifteen years. Organizing, fighting, losing, winning, losing again." [studies player] "I'm getting tired. Not of the fight—of being the only one who remembers how we got here."

**You**: "What are you saying?"

**Lopez**: "I'm saying the movement needs new leaders. People like you. People who know both worlds—the courier system and what lies beneath it."

**Option A**: "I'm not a leader." [HUMBLE]
→ Lopez: "Neither was I. Until I had to be. Leadership isn't a title—it's just standing up when standing up matters."
→ Relationship: +10

**Option B**: "What would that mean?" [PRACTICAL]
→ Lopez: "It means when I'm gone—not if, when—someone carries it forward. The meetings, the network, the idea that we're stronger together."
→ Opens leadership path

**Final Dialogue**:

**Lopez**: "Whatever you choose—Ascension, Rogue, this Third Path everyone whispers about—remember one thing: no one makes it alone. We survive together or we hollow out alone. That's the only truth I know."

## Side Quest: "The Living Wage"

### Quest ID: SQ_LOPEZ_STRIKE
**Type**: MAJOR_SIDE / FACTION
**Tier Available**: 5+
**Prerequisites**: LOPEZ_RELATIONSHIP >= 50

### Synopsis
The dockworkers are preparing a major strike against automated replacement. Lopez needs help coordinating between scattered union cells while corporate security hunts for organizers.

### Act 1: Strike Preparation

**Lopez**: "It's happening. The biggest action since the '54 uprising. Every dock worker in Red Harbor, walking off the job simultaneously." [grim] "Nakamura knows something is coming. They've got infiltrators, surveillance, maybe worse."

**You**: "What do you need from me?"

**Lopez**: "Messages. Delivered in person, no digital trail. Five locations, five cells, coordination details. If even one message doesn't get through, the strike falls apart."

**Objectives**:
1. Deliver to Cell Alpha (Warehouse District)
2. Deliver to Cell Beta (Processing Center)
3. Deliver to Cell Gamma (Container Yard)
4. Deliver to Cell Delta (Offshore Platform)
5. Deliver to Cell Epsilon (Management Mole)

### Act 2: Complications

**Encounter at Cell Delta**:

*You find the offshore cell leader, Kofi, agitated.*

**Kofi**: "Corporate security swept through an hour ago. They didn't find the list, but they know something. Someone's talking."

**Option A**: "Continue with the plan." [RISK]
**Option B**: "Delay the strike." [CAUTION]
**Option C**: "Find the informant." [INVESTIGATION]

**If Finding Informant**:
Trail leads to unexpected source—a worker whose family is being threatened by Nakamura. Player must choose:
- Turn them in to Lopez (harsh justice)
- Help them escape (mercy, but risk remains)
- Use them to feed false information (tactical)

### Act 3: The Strike

**Day of Strike**:

*The Harbor falls silent. Cranes stop. Cargo sits untouched. The city's supply chain grinds to a halt.*

**Lopez** (on comms): "It's working. They're feeling the pressure. Now we see how they respond."

**Nakamura Response**:
- Security forces mobilize
- Offers negotiation (possibly trap)
- Threatens mass replacement with drones

**Player Role During Strike**:
- Protect picket lines from corporate security
- Escort Lopez to negotiations
- Intercept security communications

**Resolution Options**:

**Nakamura Victory**: Strike broken, leaders arrested, Lopez goes underground
→ Relationship: +15 (solidarity in defeat)
→ Union weakened but survives

**Negotiated Settlement**: Some demands met, compromise reached
→ Relationship: +20
→ Union gains strength, Nakamura reputation: -10

**Worker Victory**: Full demands met, precedent set
→ Relationship: +25
→ Union becomes major faction, unlocks future content

## Lopez Combat Support

### If Lopez or Union allies present during combat:

**Lopez Entering Combat**:
"I didn't survive three strikes to die in an alley. Let's go."
"Workers protect workers. That includes you."
"Non-violence is a tactic, not a suicide pact."

**During Combat**:
"Cover the doors! Nobody gets flanked!"
"We hold this ground together!"
"Remember what we're fighting for!"

**After Combat**:
"Everyone still breathing? Good. That's the only victory that matters."
"We held. Together."
"Nakamura wanted us scared. How's that working out for them?"

---

## Lopez's Tier 10 Involvement

### Ascension Path

**Lopez**: "So you're uploading. Becoming part of the machine we've been fighting." [not angry, just tired] "I won't pretend I understand. But I hope you find what you're looking for up there."

**You**: "I wish things were different."

**Lopez**: "So do I. Every day. But wishing doesn't change systems—organizing does. Maybe you'll organize the Algorithm from the inside." [sad smile] "Stranger things have happened."

### Rogue Path

**Lopez**: "Running? Smart. Maybe the only smart choice in this whole city." [hands player a package] "This is a contact list. Mutual aid networks outside the city zone. They'll help you."

**You**: "What about you?"

**Lopez**: "Someone has to stay. Someone has to keep fighting. You go—find what's out there. Tell us if it's worth the run."

### Third Path

**Lopez**: "Balance. Integration. A middle way between meat and chrome, Algorithm and anarchy." [considers] "The union has always been about finding a third way—between exploitation and surrender. Maybe you're more one of us than you know."

**You**: "Would the union support the Third Path?"

**Lopez**: "We support workers having real choices. If the Third Path gives people that—gives everyone that—then we're with you."
→ Union support for Third Path ending
