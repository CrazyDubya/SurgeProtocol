## Synopsis

**You're Tier 2 now. "Provisional," they call it. You're past rookie mistakes, but not yet proven. The big players start to notice.**

**A corpo fixer named Delilah reaches out through Chen. She has high-paying contracts—corpo work, clean and official. Except the package you're delivering isn't medical supplies like the manifest says. It's something else. Something that makes people nervous.**

**Do you ask questions? Or do you deliver the package and take the money?**

This quest establishes:
- **Gray morality** (profitable work often involves moral compromise)
- **Faction introduction** (corpos, fixers, the real power structures)
- **Ignorance vs. knowledge** (sometimes it's safer not to know)
- **Chen's limits** (he can't protect you from everything)

## Objectives

### Primary Objective:
1. **Deliver Delilah's package to the Night Market without incident**

### Secondary Objectives:
2. **Complete delivery without inspecting contents** (ignorance = safety)
3. **Maintain plausible deniability** (don't get caught knowing what you're carrying)

### Optional Objectives:
4. **Inspect the package** (risk, but knowledge is power)
5. **Question Delilah about the contents** (she won't tell you, but you can try)
6. **Report the package to authorities** (moral choice, career-ending consequences)

### Hidden Objectives:
7. **Notice surveillance** (corpos are watching you)
8. **Connect with Delilah** (unlock future corpo contracts)

## Narrative Beats

### Act 1: Setup - "The Offer"

**Hook**: Chen calls you over. Someone's waiting in his office. A woman in expensive clothes, out of place in The Hollows.

**Meet Delilah** (Fixer Introduction):
- **Delilah**: Mid-30s, sharp, professional. Corpo-adjacent but independent. Wears power like a tailored suit.
- **Role**: Fixer—arranges deliveries between parties who can't interact directly
- **Offer**: "I have work for reliable couriers. Tier 2 is... provisional. Prove yourself, and I'll have steady work."

**THE CONTRACT**:
- Package from Meridian Medical to Night Market clinic
- Manifest says: "Medical supplies - antibiotics, diagnostic equipment"
- Pay: 500 credits (more than double standard rate)
- Condition: "Don't open the package. Don't ask questions. Deliver, collect payment, leave."

**CHEN** (after Delilah leaves):
"Delilah's corpo-adjacent. Works for Nakamura, sometimes Sentinel Corps, sometimes independents. She pays well. She also doesn't offer work to people who cause problems."

[pause]

"The package is probably not what the manifest says. That's how this works. You can refuse. Or you can take the money and don't ask questions."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "What's really in the package?" → Chen: "I don't know. And I don't want to know. Neither should you."
- "Is this legal?" → Chen: "Legally ambiguous. Gray market. Not technically illegal if you don't know what you're carrying."
- "I'll do it." → Chen: "Smart. Sometimes the money is worth the ignorance."
- "I'll pass." → Chen: "Your choice. But jobs like this are how you move up."

---

### Act 2: Complication - "Willful Ignorance"

**THE DELIVERY**:

Player picks up package from Meridian Medical facility (corpo district).

**Package details**:
- Locked metal case, biometric seal
- Manifest: Medical supplies
- Weight feels wrong (too light for equipment, maybe? too heavy for antibiotics?)
- Slight humming (electronics? refrigeration unit? something else?)

**PLAYER CHOICE POINT 1: Inspect or Ignore?**

**Option A: Ignore, Deliver** (Safe path):
- Don't inspect, follow instructions
- Complete delivery without incident
- Chen approves: "You did the smart thing."
- Delilah satisfied: "Reliable. Good."
- Humanity: 0 (neutral—you didn't participate knowingly)

**Option B: Inspect Package** (Risky path):
- Requires tech skill (hack biometric lock) OR force (break seal, damages package)
- **Contents Revealed**: Experimental neural implants (unapproved by medical boards, dangerous prototypes)
- Now you KNOW it's illegal
- Must decide: deliver anyway? Report? Destroy?

---

**IF PLAYER INSPECTS**:

**CONTENTS**: Neural implants, experimental, bleeding-edge tech. Prototypes. Unapproved for human use. High risk, high reward for corpo R&D.

**Recipient**: Night Market black clinic (they install these in desperate people for testing)

**NEW CHOICE**:

1. **Deliver Anyway** (Profit despite knowledge):
   - You know it's wrong, do it anyway
   - Humanity -5 (complicit in harm)
   - Delilah: "I didn't ask you to inspect. But you completed the job. Acceptable."
   - Unlock: Corpo contracts (morally gray work)

2. **Report to Authorities** (Moral high ground):
   - Contact corpo security or police
   - Package confiscated, Delilah blacklists you
   - Chen disappointed: "You just killed your career. Delilah runs half the high-paying work in this city."
   - Humanity +5 (stood up for ethics)
   - Consequence: Fewer high-paying contracts available long-term

3. **Destroy Package** (Sabotage):
   - Throw package in river, claim it was stolen
   - Delilah furious, blacklists you
   - Chen: "You made an enemy. Hope it was worth it."
   - Humanity +3 (prevented harm)
   - Consequence: Delilah is now an antagonist

4. **Deliver, Then Warn Recipient** (Half-measure):
   - Deliver package, but tell clinic operator what it really is
   - They might refuse it (quest fails) or accept knowingly
   - Delilah never knows you know
   - Humanity +2 (tried to help)
   - Relationship: Neutral

---

**IF PLAYER DOESN'T INSPECT**:

**Smooth Delivery**:
- Arrive at Night Market clinic
- Hand off package, get paid
- See nervous clinic operator (clearly knows this is illegal)
- Option to ask: "What's in this?" (they won't tell you)

**Brief Moment of Doubt**:
Clinic operator: "You... you don't know, do you? Good. Keep it that way. For both our sakes."

**Player intuition**: This is wrong. But you don't know HOW wrong. Plausible deniability intact.

---

### Act 3: Resolution - "Welcome to the Gray"

**Return to Chen**:

**IF PLAYER DELIVERED (INSPECTED OR NOT)**:

**CHEN**: "Delilah confirmed delivery. Good work. She'll have more for you."

[if player inspected]

"I can tell you know what was in there. And you delivered anyway. That's... pragmatic. Or complicit. Depends on how you justify it."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "I needed the money." → Chen: "We all do. That's how they get us."
- "It's not my responsibility." → Chen: "Keep telling yourself that."
- "I didn't have a choice." → Chen: "You always have a choice. Sometimes all the options just suck."

**DELILAH** (calls):
"Reliable and discreet. Exactly what I need. I'll have more work for you. Tier 2 is provisional. Prove yourself on a few more runs, and I'll bring you into the real contracts."

**Unlock**: Delilah as contact, corpo faction +10, gray market contracts available

---

**IF PLAYER REPORTED/DESTROYED**:

**CHEN**: "Delilah called. She's... not happy. You cost her client relationship, broke chain of trust. She won't work with you again."

[sighs]

"I get it. You have ethics. But this job doesn't reward that. The people who pay well pay well because they're doing things they shouldn't. You just locked yourself out of a lot of income."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "I did the right thing." → Chen: "Maybe. But the right thing doesn't pay rent."
- "I couldn't live with myself otherwise." → Chen: "Fair. Just know—there's a cost to that."

**Unlock**: Delilah blacklisted (no corpo contracts), Union/Ghost Network respect +5 (word spreads you have principles)

---

**ROSA** (if player talks to her):

**If delivered**:
"Heard you're running with Delilah now. Corpo fixer. Just... be careful, yeah? That world chews people up."

**If reported**:
"Heard you turned down corpo money. That took guts. Stupid, maybe, but guts."

- If package is inspected and open, illegal goods visible
- Must bribe or hide evidence

**Moral Weight** (if delivered knowingly):
- Later quest shows consequences (victim of experimental implant)

## Narrative Function

This quest serves as:
1. **Gray Morality Introduction**: Profitable work involves moral compromise
2. **Faction Gateway**: Opens corpo path or closes it
3. **Ignorance vs. Knowledge**: Sometimes it's safer not to know
4. **Delilah Introduction**: Recurring fixer character
5. **Player Values Test**: Ethics vs. survival economics

**The central question**: *Is ignorance complicity? If you don't ask what's in the package, are you responsible for what's inside?*

---

## Writing Notes

### Delilah's Character
- Professional, not evil
- Sees courier work as business, not morality play
- Respects reliability above all
- Won't force you, but won't forgive refusal

### Chen's Perspective
- Knows this is how the world works
- Disappointed if player reports (career suicide)
- Understands if player refuses (but warns of consequences)
- Himself made these compromises to survive

### Tone
- Moral ambiguity (no clear right answer)
- Economic pressure (need money to survive)
- Systemic complicity (everyone's dirty somehow)
- Player agency (real choice with real consequences)
