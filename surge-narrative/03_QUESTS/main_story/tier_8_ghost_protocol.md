## Synopsis

**You're Tier 8. Top 1%. Everyone knows your name. And everyone wants you.**

**Within 24 hours, you receive offers from: Nakamura Cybernetics (corpo Ascension program), the Union Collective (organized resistance), and a mysterious Ghost Network operative (off-grid extraction). They're not asking you to choose now—just to know the options exist.**

**But one faction doesn't send a recruiter. They send a threat: eliminate you or convert you. And you have to survive long enough to reach Tier 9 to make the actual choice.**

This quest establishes:
- **Faction recruitment** (everyone pitches their vision)

2. **Survive assassination attempt** (rival faction tries to eliminate you)
3. **Choose which factions to engage with** (or ignore all)

### Secondary Objectives:
4. **Learn each faction's offer** (Ascension program, Union protection, Ghost extraction)
5. **Identify who sent the hit** (which faction sees you as threat)

### Optional Objectives:
6. **Negotiate with multiple factions** (play them against each other)
7. **Reject all offers** (stay independent)
8. **Accept one faction's protection** (alliance)

### Hidden Objectives:
9. **Discover Ghost Network safe houses** (unlocks Rogue path resources)
10. **Learn about Union's Third Path research** (connects to Solomon)

## Narrative Beats

### Act 1: Setup - "The Offers"

**Hook**: Three messages arrive within hours.

**MESSAGE 1** (Corpo - Nakamura):
"Congratulations on Tier 8. You qualify for our Ascension Preparatory Program. Premium upload facilities, priority queue, full integration support. Please contact Director Yamada at your convenience. This is an exclusive opportunity."

**MESSAGE 2** (Union - Encrypted):
"Tier 8 courier. You've seen how the system works. Gig economy, rating tyranny, corpo exploitation. We offer alternative: Union membership, collective bargaining, escape routes if needed. Meet us. No obligation. —Lopez"

**MESSAGE 3** (Ghost Network - Triple Encrypted):
"You're being watched. By everyone. We can make you disappear when you're ready. No rating, no Algorithm, no corps. But first, we meet. Proof we exist. —Ghost"

**CHEN** (when player tells him):
"Three factions, one courier. You're Tier 8 now. Valuable. Everyone wants to secure you before Tier 9, when you make the big choice."

[concerned]

"Be careful. When you're this valuable, elimination becomes an option. If they can't recruit you, they make sure no one else can."

### Act 2: Complication - "The Meetings"

**MEETING 1: Corpo (Nakamura Director)**

**Location**: High-rise corpo tower, sterile elegance

**Director Yamada**: Polished, professional, sells Ascension

"Tier 8 is impressive. But Tier 9? That's where you face mortality. The body ages, breaks, dies. We offer transcendence. Upload your consciousness, join Synthesis, achieve immortality."

"Our Ascension program includes: Priority queue (no waiting), premium neural mapping (higher fidelity copy), integration coaching (smooth transition), and corporate sponsorship (your family receives compensation)."

"You've worked so hard to get here. Don't let death steal your achievement. Ascend. Become eternal."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "I'm interested. Tell me more." → Yamada provides details, contract terms
- "What about the upload truth? That it kills the original?" → Yamada: "The copy is continuous. You wake up. That's survival."
- "I'll think about it." → Yamada: "Of course. But decide soon. Tier 9 comes fast."
- "Not interested." → Yamada: [cold] "Unfortunate. Few refuse immortality. Mortality is... limiting."

**Unlock**: Corpo Ascension program details, priority upload access (if accepted)

---

**MEETING 2: Union (Organizer Lopez)**

**Location**: Union hall, worker-focused, communal

**Lopez**: Passionate, tired, believes in collective action

"You're Tier 8. You got here by being better than everyone else. Competing. Stepping on others. That's what the system wants—division."

"The Union offers alternative: Collective bargaining (negotiate as group), mutual aid (we help each other), and escape infrastructure (when you're ready to leave, we get you out)."

"We're not saying go Rogue now. We're saying: when the corps try to own you at Tier 9—Ascension, debt contracts, golden handcuffs—you have support. You're not alone."

"Also..." [leans in, quieter] "We've been researching something. A third way. Not Ascension, not Rogue. Balance. There's a man named Solomon who—"

[stops]

"Never mind. If you're interested, come back. We'll talk more."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "I want to join the Union." → Lopez: "Good. We'll protect you. Solidarity."
- "Tell me about Solomon." → Lopez: "Not yet. Earn trust first. But... he found a way to keep himself without surrendering to the Algorithm."
- "I work alone." → Lopez: "That's what they want you to think. But okay. Offer stands."

**Unlock**: Union membership (if accepted), hints about Third Path, escape network access

---

**MEETING 3: Ghost Network (Operative "Phantom")**

**Location**: Hidden meet (Interstitial access required, or alternative neutral ground)

**Phantom**: Face obscured, voice modulated, mysterious

"We're the people who vanished. Faked deaths, erased records, went dark. The Algorithm thinks we're dead. The corps stopped looking. We're free."

"Tier 8 means you're almost at the decision point. When you hit Tier 9, if you choose Rogue, we'll help. False identities, safe houses, extraction from the city. You become a ghost."

"We don't ask you to decide now. Just know: when the time comes, we'll be here. And we're very good at making people disappear."

**PLAYER OPTIONS**:
- "How many people have you extracted?" → Phantom: "Forty-seven. All Tier 7+. All alive, off-grid, free."
- "What's the catch?" → Phantom: "No rating system. No Algorithm. No modern conveniences. You live analog, hidden, simple. Some can't handle it."
- "Can I contact you again?" → Phantom: [hands encrypted device] "Use this. Once. When you're ready."

**Unlock**: Ghost Network contact, extraction capability (if Rogue chosen), emergency escape option

---

### Act 3: Resolution - "The Hit"

**THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT**:

**Setup**: After all meetings, player receives urgent delivery contract. High value, suspicious.

**ALGORITHM** (if relationship good):
"This contract is... anomalous. Client is shell corporation. Destination is isolated. Threat probability: 68%. Recommendation: Decline."

**ALGORITHM** (if relationship strained):
"Contract accepted. Routing." [doesn't warn]

**If player proceeds** (or is ambushed regardless):

**AMBUSH**: Rival faction (or corpo hit squad) attempts to eliminate player.

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Must fight/flee/negotiate.

**ATTACKERS**:
- Professional, augmented, sent by faction that sees player as threat
- Dialogue reveals: "You're too valuable to let another faction have. If we can't recruit you, no one gets you."

**RESOLUTION OPTIONS**:

1. **Fight, Win**: Defeat attackers, prove your worth
2. **Flee, Evade**: Escape, survive, but rattled
3. **Negotiate**: "Who sent you? I'll talk to them." (Charm/Intimidate check)
4. **Call for Help**: Contact one of the three factions (creates debt/alliance)

---

**POST-AMBUSH**:

**CHEN**:
"I warned you. Tier 8 makes you a target. Someone decided you're too risky to leave unaligned. You okay?"

[if player fought]

"You survived. Good. But this won't be the last. Tier 9 is coming. When you choose, some faction loses. They'll remember."

---

**FACTION REACTIONS** (if player contacts them about hit):

**Corpo**: "We had nothing to do with this. But... this proves our point. Embodied existence is vulnerable. Upload, and no one can kill you."

**Union**: "This is exactly what we fight against. Corpo violence, silencing dissent. Join us. We'll protect you."

**Ghost Network**: "You were marked for elimination. We can make you disappear tonight if you want. Just say the word."

---

## Writing Notes

### Faction Pitches
- **Corpo**: Seductive but cold (immortality as product)
- **Union**: Passionate but tired (fighting impossible battle)
- **Ghost Network**: Mysterious but genuine (freedom through erasure)

### Assassination Attempt
- Not gratuitous violence—story point
- Shows consequences of value
- Tests player's ability to survive without faction protection

### Lopez's Third Path Hint
- Brief mention of Solomon
- Doesn't explain fully (player must discover)
- Connects Union to Solomon's philosophy (balance, not Ascension or Rogue)

### Tone
- Recruitment pressure (everyone wants you)
- Paranoia (someone tried to kill you)
- Agency (you can still refuse everyone)
- Anticipation (Tier 9 is close)
