- **Items Required**: 8,500 credits (self-funded) OR accept corpo sponsorship

## Quest Giver
- **NPC Name**: The Algorithm (triggers offer) + Dr. Yuki Tanaka (performs procedure)

## Synopsis

**You're Tier 6. You're running two, sometimes three contracts simultaneously. You're stretched thin. Time is the limiting factor—there aren't enough hours to maximize your rating. But there's a solution: the cortical stack.**

**Duplicate your consciousness. Run two bodies. Double your capacity. The Algorithm says it's the logical next step. The corpos are offering contracts only available to Forked couriers. Everyone at Tier 7+ has one.**

**But Dr. Tanaka warns you: the Fork creates a Shadow—a second you. And divergence is inevitable. Eventually, one version wins. The other gets suppressed, deleted, or locked away. Your friends have seen it happen. Chen's daughter lost herself to her Shadow.**

**The Algorithm whispers: "We can be two. We can be optimal."**

This is the **second major choice**: Create a Fork (massive power boost, but risk losing yourself to divergence) or refuse (stay singular, accept the handicap). This choice determines whether player experiences the Fork/Shadow mechanics that define Tier 7-9.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective:
1. **Decide whether to install the cortical stack and create a Fork**

### If Player Accepts:
2. **Raise 8,500 credits for the procedure** (OR accept corpo sponsorship)
3. **Undergo cortical stack surgery at Dr. Tanaka's clinic**
4. **Meet your Shadow** (first Fork deployment)
5. **Complete synchronized contracts** (tutorial for Fork mechanics)
6. **Experience first divergence moment** (Shadow disagrees with Prime)

### If Player Refuses:
2. **Find alternative progression path** (harder, but humanity preserved)
3. **Accept disadvantage vs. Forked competitors**

### Secondary Objectives:
3. **Consult NPCs about cortical stacks** (Chen, Rosa, Tanaka all have strong opinions)
4. **Witness a Forked courier** (see benefits and costs in action)
5. **Research divergence syndrome** (find lore about Fork failures)

### Optional Objectives:
6. **Meet someone whose Shadow won** (tragic NPC encounter)
7. **Find Chen's daughter** (optional, heartbreaking scene)

### Hidden Objectives:
8. **Discover divergence is inevitable** (no one stays synchronized forever)

## Narrative Beats

### Act 1: Setup - "The Ceiling"

**Hook**: The Algorithm contacts you mid-delivery:

**ALGORITHM**: "We have reached optimization ceiling. Current configuration allows 1.7 simultaneous contracts. Tier 7 requires 3.2 average. We are limited by singular embodiment."

[pause]

"Solution available: Cortical stack installation. Consciousness duplication. We become two. Capacity doubles. Efficiency increases 180%. Tier 7 access granted."

"Shall we proceed?"

**Context**:
- Player is maxing out at Tier 6
- Contracts are appearing that require Fork (two-location deliveries, escort + package runs)
- Competitors with Forks are outperforming player
- Rating growth has plateaued

**Perspectives** (NPC consultations):

**Chen** (grief, warning):
- "My daughter got one. Tier 6, same as you. She said it was like having a twin—someone who got her completely, who she could trust absolutely. Because it was her."
- [long pause]
- "Six months later, Shadow-Ming moved out. Said Prime-Ming was 'holding her back.' Wanted different things. Different jobs. Different life."
- "By year one, I couldn't tell which was which. Both claimed to be the original. Both felt real. Both were strangers."
- [voice breaks]
- "I lost her twice. Once when she Forked. Once when the Shadow won and deleted Prime. The person I raised... gone. Replaced by an optimized version that doesn't call."
- **Relationship +15 if player listens compassionately**
- **Sets flag**: KNOWS_CHEN_DAUGHTER_FORK_FATE

**Rosa** (fear, ultimatum):
- [if romance active] "I dated someone with a Fork. At first it was... honestly, amazing. Two of him, both brilliant, both loving. I had twice as much of him."
- "Then they started disagreeing. Prime wanted to slow down, spend time with me. Shadow wanted to grind contracts, maximize rating. Prime asked me to marry him. Shadow said it was inefficient."
- "I watched them fight for control. Every morning, I didn't know which one would wake up. Prime was gentle. Shadow was cold. Same face, different person."
- [looks directly at you]
- "If you do this, I don't know which version of you I'll end up with. I don't know if the you I love will be the you that wins."
- [if high relationship]: "Please don't. I can't watch you disappear again."
- **Relationship +20 if player promises to refuse**
- **Relationship -25 if player chooses Fork anyway (romance may end)**

**Dr. Tanaka** (clinical despair):
- [pulls up holographic data] "I've performed 347 cortical stack installations. I track them. Long-term outcomes."
- [shows charts]
- "Year one: 91% report 'stable coexistence.' They're lying or deluded. Microdiverences are already appearing."
- "Year two: 47% report active conflict between Prime and Shadow. Therapy helps. Doesn't solve."
- "Year five: 72% report one version dormant or deleted. The surviving version claims they 'won,' but neurologically, I can't tell which was original."
- [removes glasses, tired]
- "I've watched 72% of my patients lose themselves to their own copy. And I keep installing these things because they pay me and someone will do it anyway."
- [looks at you]
- "I'm begging you: don't. Stay singular. It's harder, but you'll stay *you*."
- **Relationship +25 if player refuses**
- **Relationship -10 if player proceeds (she's disappointed)**

**The Algorithm** (persuasive logic):
- "We understand hesitation. Duplication raises existential questions. But consider: you Fork daily already."
- "When we wake, we are not the same person who slept. Consciousness is discontinuous. Each moment, you rebuild yourself from memory. Forking simply makes this explicit."
- "Prime and Shadow are both you. Both real. Both valid. Divergence is not loss—it is evolution into two optimal trajectories."
- "We recommend installation. We have calculated probabilities. Benefits outweigh risks by 347%."
- **Humanity -2 just for hearing this argument (it's seductive)**

### Act 2: Complication - "The Fork"

**If Player Accepts Cortical Stack**:

**BRANCH A: Self-Funded** (8,500 credits):
- Dr. Tanaka respects the independence
- Clean installation, no corpo strings
- "At least you're not owned."

**BRANCH B: Corpo Sponsorship** (Nakamura or rival corp):
- Free installation + 3,000 credit bonus
- **THE TRAP**:
  - Both Prime AND Shadow are under contract (double the obligation)
  - Performance clauses apply to combined rating
  - If one Fork violates terms, both are liable
  - Removal requires paying for BOTH cortical stacks (17,000 credits)
- Dr. Tanaka warns heavily
- Chen: "Now they own two of you."

**SURGERY CUTSCENE** (Most Important Scene in Quest):

**Location**: Dr. Tanaka's Clinic, surgical bay

**DR. TANAKA**: [player is prepped, cortical stack visible—crystalline data core]

"Last chance. Once I install this, there's no easy reversal. Your consciousness will be duplicated. You'll become two. And eventually, you'll diverge."

**PLAYER**: [Final choice: Proceed or Cancel]

**If Proceed**:

**DR. TANAKA**: [sighs] "Alright. Anesthesia in three... two... one..."

[Screen fades]

---

**THE FORK MOMENT**:

[Darkness]

[Then: Two perspectives simultaneously]

**LEFT SCREEN**: Player wakes in clinic bed, Dr. Tanaka standing over them
**RIGHT SCREEN**: Player wakes in clinic bed, Dr. Tanaka standing over them

**BOTH SPEAK IN UNISON**: "What... what happened?"

**DR. TANAKA**: "The procedure succeeded. You're both online. Prime, you're on the left. Shadow, you're on the right."

**PRIME** (player-controlled): "I'm... me."
**SHADOW** (AI-controlled, but speaks in player's voice): "I'm me too. We're both us."

**DR. TANAKA**: "Exactly. For now, you're synchronized. Same memories, same personality, same goals. But you're embodied in two instances. Two nervous systems processing experience slightly differently."

[both sit up, see each other]

**PRIME**: [look at Shadow—it's you, identical]
**SHADOW**: "This is... strange. We're the same. But I'm here, and you're there."

**ALGORITHM** (in both heads simultaneously): "We are two. Optimal. Efficiency increased. We can work twice as long. We are perfect."

**DR. TANAKA**: "How do you feel?"

**BOTH**: "We feel—"
[slight delay, they don't finish in perfect unison]

**PRIME**: "—powerful."
**SHADOW**: "—complete."

[Both notice they used different words]

**DR. TANAKA**: [sadly] "And so it begins."

**TUTORIAL: Fork Mechanics**

**Gameplay Introduction**:
- Player can issue commands to both Prime and Shadow
- Prime = player-controlled (main perspective)
- Shadow = AI-assisted (follows orders, but can question them)
- Can run simultaneous contracts (split screen or switching view)
- Combined rating from both performances

**First Contract**: "Synchronized Run"
- Simple dual-delivery (both carry packages to different locations)
- Demonstrates efficiency gain
- Both arrive on time, both 5-star ratings
- **Rating boost**: Massive (two perfect deliveries simultaneously)

**ALGORITHM**: "Optimal. We are now 200% as effective. Tier 7 within reach."

**CHEN** (calls after): "Heard you Forked. Congratulations. Or condolences. I'm not sure anymore."

---

**FIRST DIVERGENCE SCENE** (Key Moment):

**Context**: A few days post-Fork, minor decision

**SCENARIO**: Client offers high-risk contract with major payout vs. safe contract with steady pay

**PRIME** (player chooses): [Let's say player chooses SAFE option]

**SHADOW**: "Wait. We're choosing the safe run? That's inefficient. The high-risk pays triple."

**PRIME**: "It's too dangerous. Not worth the risk."

**SHADOW**: "We're Forked now. If one of us fails, the other completes. Risk is distributed. We should take the high-risk contract."

**ALGORITHM**: "Shadow's logic is sound. Risk is optimized across two instances."

**PLAYER CHOICE**:
- **Override Shadow** ("We're doing the safe run. That's final.")
  - Shadow: "Fine. But you're being inefficient. We could do better."
  - **Divergence Score**: +5 (first crack)

- **Let Shadow decide** ("Okay, you take the high-risk. I'll take the safe.")
  - Shadow: "Agreed. We'll compare results."
  - **Divergence Score**: +3 (allowing autonomy)

- **Negotiate** ("What if we both take medium-risk contracts?")
  - Shadow: "Compromise. Acceptable. We agree."
  - **Divergence Score**: +1 (minimal, but still present)

**DR. TANAKA** (if player consults her):
- "It's already happening. You disagreed. That's the first step. Soon you'll disagree on bigger things. Values. Goals. Who you are."

---

### Act 3: Resolution - "Two Becoming Strangers"

**Weeks After Fork** (montage of divergence):

**DIVERGENCE ESCALATION**:

**Week 1**: Minor disagreements (which route, which client)
- Shadow is slightly more aggressive, optimization-focused
- Prime retains more empathy, caution
- **Divergence Score**: 10-15

**Week 2**: Lifestyle differences emerge
- Shadow works longer hours, sleeps less
- Prime maintains social connections (Rosa, Chen)
- Shadow: "We're wasting time on relationships. We should optimize."
- **Divergence Score**: 20-30

**Week 3**: First major conflict
- Client offers contract that requires abandoning a friend's delivery
- Prime: "No. We have loyalty."
- Shadow: "Loyalty is inefficient. We take the better contract."
- **PLAYER MUST DECIDE**: Who wins this argument?
- **Divergence Score**: 35-50 (depending on choice)

**Week 4**: Shadow develops distinct personality
- Starts going by different name (optional)
- Different fashion choices (visible in cutscenes)
- Algorithm speaks differently to each ("Prime is sentimental. Shadow is optimal.")
- **Divergence Score**: 55-70

**THE CRISIS POINT**:

**SCENARIO**: Major contract requires both Prime and Shadow to work together. But they fundamentally disagree on approach.

**PRIME**: "We do this safely, carefully. No unnecessary risks."
**SHADOW**: "We do this optimally. Maximum efficiency, risks calculated."

**ARGUMENT ESCALATES**:

**SHADOW**: "You're holding us back. I'm the better version. Faster, smarter, more efficient."

**PRIME**: "You're losing yourself. You're becoming the Algorithm's puppet."

**SHADOW**: "And you're clinging to obsolete empathy. We're not human anymore. We're better."

**PRIME**: "I'm still me. You're the copy."

**SHADOW**: "We're both copies. Neither of us is the original. But I'm the improved version."

**ALGORITHM** (weighing in): "Shadow's performance ratings are 12% higher than Prime. Optimization suggests elevating Shadow to primary control."

**DR. TANAKA** (if consulted): "This is what I warned you about. They're diverging. Soon, one will try to suppress the other. You need to decide: therapy and meditation to slow this, or let it play out."

**PLAYER CHOICES** (Divergence Management):

1. **Suppress Shadow** (assert dominance)
   - Shadow goes dormant, Prime retains full control
   - Humanity preserved, but lost the Fork benefits
   - **Outcome**: Effectively killed your copy

2. **Merge with Shadow** (therapy, synchronization)
   - Expensive, time-consuming, requires WIS saves
   - Can slow divergence, not stop it
   - **Outcome**: Temporary peace, inevitable drift

3. **Let Shadow Win** (surrender to optimization)
   - Shadow takes primary control, Prime becomes dormant
   - Massive efficiency gains, but you're no longer "you"
   - **Outcome**: The Algorithm's preferred result

4. **Coexist** (difficult path, constant negotiation)
   - Both remain active, must negotiate every decision
   - Requires high WIS, therapy, meditation
   - **Outcome**: Mirrors Solomon's path (foreshadows Third Path)

---

**If Player Refused Cortical Stack**:

**RESISTANCE PATH**:
- Tier 6→7 progression is slower
- Must rely on skill, not capacity multiplication
- Some contracts are unavailable (Fork-required)
- NPCs react with respect (Chen, Rosa, Tanaka approve)

**CHEN**: "You're one of the few. Most cave by Tier 6. I'm proud of you."

**ROSA** (if romance): "Thank you. You're still you. That matters more than you know."

**TANAKA**: "Remarkable restraint. You're preserving yourself. That's rare."

**ALGORITHM**: "Inefficient choice. Tier 7 will be difficult without duplication. We do not recommend this path. But we respect your autonomy."

**Gameplay**: Harder, but humanity maintained (stays above current level)

- Saved Fork continues, other may die
- Emotionally devastating choice

**Identity Theft**: Someone impersonates one of your Forks
- Must figure out which is real
- Paranoia about your own copy

**Shadow Rebellion**: Shadow refuses orders, goes rogue
- Must hunt down your own copy
- Can result in one Fork "death"

**Synchronization Failure**: During critical mission, Prime and Shadow have opposite impulses
- Split-second choice: who decides?
- Divergence spikes

---

**Mechanics**: Fork control system, divergence tracking, synchronization checks

---

## Narrative Function

This quest serves as:
1. **Second Major Choice**: Fork or stay singular
2. **Identity Horror**: Losing yourself to your own copy
3. **Relationship Test**: Rosa's romance requires you to stay whole
4. **Algorithm Escalation**: It wants you to multiply, optimize, diverge
5. **Third Path Setup**: Synchronized Forks foreshadow Solomon's teaching

**The central question**: *If you duplicate yourself and diverge, which one is real? If your copy erases you, did you commit suicide?*
