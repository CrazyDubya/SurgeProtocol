## Main Story Quest Items

### The Algorithm Chip (Tier 3)

**Item Type**: Neural Interface Component
**Quest**: "The Whisper"
**Significance**: First direct Algorithm connection

**Description**:
A wafer-thin chip no larger than a fingernail, its surface a labyrinth of microscopic circuits that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. This is the key to hearing the Algorithm's voice—and the first step toward whatever comes after.

**Examination Text**:
"Standard Nakamura design, but the architecture is... wrong. Too complex for simple communication. This isn't just a receiver. It's a door. And doors open both ways."

**Rosa's Comment** (if present):
"That's the chip? It looks almost alive. Be careful what you let into your head."

### Mei-Lin's Data Core (Tier 5)

**Item Type**: Corrupted Storage Device
**Quest**: "The Space Between"
**Significance**: Evidence of Fork failure

**Description**:
A standard data core, except for the crack running through its center and the faint hum that suggests it's still partially active. Inside are the fragmented memories of Chen's daughter—or what's left of them.

**Examination Text**:
"The corruption isn't technical. It's... existential. Two sets of memories trying to occupy the same space. Two Mei-Lins, fighting for dominance. Neither survived the war."

**Chen's Comment** (if player shows him):
"She's still in there. Both of her. Trapped in a loop of becoming and unbecoming. Is that existence? Or a new kind of death?"

### Okonkwo's Balance Pendant (Tier 7)

**Item Type**: Symbolic Token
**Quest**: "The Consultation"
**Significance**: Third Path initiation

**Description**:
A small pendant on a leather cord—half polished chrome, half raw stone. The transition between materials is seamless, as if they grew together naturally. It weighs more than it should.

**Examination Text**:
"The Interstitial symbol. Neither purely chrome nor purely flesh. The weight you feel isn't physical—it's the weight of a philosophy. A reminder that balance requires constant effort."

**Okonkwo's Words**:
"Wear it or don't. The symbol isn't the path—you are. But some find it helps to have a reminder when the world demands you choose a side."

---

### The Convergence Key (Tier 9)

**Item Type**: Access Device
**Quest**: "The Convergence"
**Significance**: Unlocks final choices

**Description**:
Not a physical key—a pattern of electromagnetic frequencies embedded in a crystalline matrix. It pulses with light that seems to sync with your heartbeat. Or your chrome. Hard to tell the difference anymore.

**Examination Text**:
"This opens the way to the Upload Chamber. Or the escape tunnels. Or the Interstitial's deepest sanctum. It doesn't care which door you choose—only that you choose."

**Algorithm Comment**:
"The key recognizes you. All paths are open now. All endings are possible. Choose well, Courier. This is the last choice that will be entirely yours."

### Voronov's Source Code (Hidden Quest)

**Item Type**: Data Crystal
**Quest**: "The Voronov Legacy"
**Significance**: Original Algorithm blueprint

**Description**:
An ancient crystal format, pre-Nakamura. The data within is compressed beyond modern standards—more information than should physically fit. This is the Algorithm's original source code. Before the corruption. Before the control.

**Examination Text**:
"Comments in the code. Human thoughts preserved in digital amber. 'To help them live better.' 'Never to control.' 'If this is misused, may whoever finds this forgive me.' Voronov knew. He knew what might happen."

**Voronov's Words** (if found in quest):
"I wrote it with love. They rewrote it with greed. Can you undo what they've done? That code is my apology. Use it well."

## Side Quest Items

### Rosa's Brother's Dog Tags (Rosa Arc)

**Item Type**: Personal Memento
**Quest**: "Blood and Oil"
**Significance**: Miguel rescue evidence

**Description**:
Military-issue identification tags, bent and scratched. The name is still legible: DELGADO, MIGUEL. The chain is broken—torn off rather than removed.

**Examination Text**:
"These were taken by force. Whoever has them is sending a message: we have him, and we're not being gentle."

**Rosa's Reaction**:
"Miguel's tags. He never takes them off. Never." [voice breaking] "They hurt him to get these. I'll hurt them back."

---

### The Union Manifesto (Lopez Arc)

**Item Type**: Propaganda Document
**Quest**: "The Living Wage"
**Significance**: Worker solidarity symbol

**Description**:
A worn pamphlet, reprinted so many times the words are almost illegible. But the message is clear: workers united cannot be defeated. Signatures of a hundred strikers mark the margins.

**Examination Text**:
"Each signature is a person who risked everything for collective action. Some of these names are dead now. Some uploaded against their will. But their signatures remain—testimony that they fought."

**Lopez's Words**:
"Every union starts with a document like this. Every revolution starts with people willing to sign their names. Are you willing?"

### Jin's Old ID Badge (Jin Arc)

**Item Type**: Obsolete Identification
**Quest**: "Quicksilver Down"
**Significance**: Jin's past revealed

**Description**:
A courier badge from Jin's first days—Tier 1, rookie photo, different name. "Park, Jin-Soo." Before they became Quicksilver. Before they built walls to hide behind.

**Examination Text**:
"The face in the photo looks younger. Softer. Hopeful, even. Whatever happened between then and now carved that hope away. Left something faster, harder. But maybe not better."

**Jin's Comment** (if shown):
"Where did you... I thought I destroyed all of those." [long pause] "That was a different person. Don't look at me like that person still exists."

### The Prometheus Fragment (Tanaka Arc)

**Item Type**: Research Sample
**Quest**: "The Humane Path"
**Significance**: Original Algorithm component

**Description**:
A sealed container holding a sliver of crystallized data. The original Prometheus architecture—before Nakamura renamed it "The Algorithm." Before they twisted its purpose.

**Examination Text**:
"Dr. Tanaka's research depends on this. The original code, before the corruption. If she can study it, maybe she can build something better. Something that helps instead of controls."

**Tanaka's Words**:
"This is it. The fragment Voronov hid before they caught him. Decades of searching, and here it is. You've given me the key to everything."

---

### The Chrome Saint Medal (Chrome Saints)

**Item Type**: Religious Symbol
**Quest**: Chrome Saints side content
**Significance**: Faction allegiance token

**Description**:
A medal depicting the Chrome Saint—half-skeleton, half-machine, arms raised in benediction. The metal is warm to the touch, as if alive. The Chrome Saints believe it is.

**Examination Text**:
"The Chrome Saints see this as holy—proof that the merger of flesh and chrome is divine rather than profane. To wear it is to declare faith in metal salvation."

**Chrome Saint Comment**:
"You carry the Saint's blessing now. May your chrome guide you to transcendence, and may your flesh remember what it was to doubt."

## Collectibles

### Voronov's Journal Pages (5 scattered)

**Item Type**: Collectible Lore
**Significance**: Background on Algorithm's creation

**Page 1** - "Day one of the Prometheus Project. If this works, we can optimize the whole city. Traffic, resources, human potential. A benevolent guide, not a controller."

**Page 2** - "Nakamura's offer is generous. Too generous. But the funding would let me complete the project in months instead of years. What's the harm?"

**Page 3** - "They've asked me to add upload protocols. I said no. They said it wasn't a request. I'm beginning to understand what I've sold."

**Page 4** - "I've hidden the original source code. If they find it, they'll corrupt it like they've corrupted everything else. Someone, someday, needs to know what we intended."

**Page 5** - "I'm going underground. They'll say I'm dead—or worse, that I was always loyal to their vision. But somewhere, somehow, the truth will survive. It has to."

### Pre-Algorithm Photographs (8 scattered)

**Item Type**: Collectible Lore
**Significance**: Glimpses of the world before Integration

**Photo 1**: A street scene without visible chrome. People walking, talking, unaugmented. Caption: "Summer 2047."

**Photo 2**: Children playing in a park that's now a corporate processing center. Caption: "Before the towers."

**Photo 3**: A family dinner—no Algorithm interfaces visible. Caption: "When we chose our own meals."

**Photo 4**: A wedding ceremony in a church. Caption: "They promised 'til death do us part. The Algorithm changed what death meant."

**Photo 5**: A protest march. Signs reading "NO FORCED UPLOADS." Caption: "We fought. We lost."

**Photo 6**: An old man holding his own chrome arm, looking at it with wonder and fear. Caption: "Father's first augment. He cried for three days."

**Photo 7**: A cityscape without the Algorithm's visible infrastructure. Caption: "The skyline before it watched us back."

**Photo 8**: A handwritten note: "To whoever finds these—remember what we were. We weren't always this."
