## Neural Augmentations

### Cochlear Implant (Tier 3 Required)
**Category**: Neural / Communication
**Humanity Cost**: 15
**Manufacturer**: Nakamura Biotech

**Description**:
"Standard-issue neural interface allowing direct Algorithm communication. The whisper in your ear that never sleeps. Installation requires surgical access to the auditory cortex—a 4-hour procedure with 97.3% survival rate."

**Lore Text**:
"The cochlear implant was Nakamura's masterstroke. Not mandatory—never mandatory—but try getting a Tier 4+ job without one. The Algorithm doesn't force itself on you. It just makes sure you can't succeed without it."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I remember silence. The first night after installation, I couldn't sleep. Not because of pain—because the quiet was gone. Forever."* — Anonymous courier, subsequently uploaded

### Cortical Stack (Tier 6 Required)
**Category**: Neural / Backup
**Humanity Cost**: 25
**Manufacturer**: Nakamura Biotech

**Description**:
"Continuous consciousness backup system. Records neural patterns in real-time, enabling Fork creation and theoretical immortality. Installation site: base of skull. Warning: Divergence between Prime and Shadow personalities is normal and expected."

**Lore Text**:
"They call it insurance. A backup of you, running in parallel, ready to take over if the original fails. What they don't tell you: the backup starts having its own opinions. Its own plans. And it remembers everything you choose to forget."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"Which one of us is real? I used to know. The Stack remembers everything except the answer to that question."* — Fork Integration Support Group pamphlet

### Neural Processor (Tier 4 Required)
**Category**: Neural / Cognitive
**Humanity Cost**: 12
**Manufacturer**: Apex Dynamics

**Description**:
"Cognitive enhancement array. Improves reaction time, pattern recognition, and data processing. Side effects may include reduced emotional affect, difficulty with creative tasks, and occasional déjà vu."

**Lore Text**:
"The processor doesn't make you smarter. It makes you faster. You'll solve the puzzle before you understand why. You'll dodge the punch before you feel afraid. The gap between stimulus and response vanishes—and so does something harder to name."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I can calculate trajectories in my head now. Ballistics, crowd movements, optimal escape routes. I just can't remember why I used to cry at sunsets."* — Dr. Eliza Vance, before resignation from Nakamura R&D

**Humanity Cost**: 10
**Manufacturer**: DataVault Inc.

**Description**:
"Expanded neural storage allowing perfect recall of stored experiences. Can record and replay memories with full sensory fidelity. Warning: Memory editing features require additional licensing."

**Lore Text**:
"Perfect memory sounds like a gift. Then you remember every failure in crystalline detail. Every loss. Every word you wish you'd never said. Some users pay extra for the deletion package. The waiting list is years long."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I can replay my daughter's first steps whenever I want. I can also replay the moment she told me she was uploading. I can't delete either one."* — Support forum post, deleted by moderator

**Humanity Cost**: 8
**Manufacturer**: ClearSight Corp

**Description**:
"Full-spectrum visual upgrade. Includes low-light enhancement, zoom capability, and optional AR overlay. Replacement of organic eyes recommended but not required for basic package."

**Lore Text**:
"The sales pitch focuses on seeing in the dark. They don't mention how the world looks different when you see it through manufactured lenses. Colors aren't quite right anymore. Faces look like data points. Maybe they always were."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"My girlfriend said I look at her differently now. She's right. I can see her heartrate, her stress levels, her micro-expressions. I just can't see her the way I used to."* — Product review, 3 stars

---

### Auditory Boost (Tier 3 Required)
**Category**: Sensory / Hearing
**Humanity Cost**: 6
**Manufacturer**: Nakamura Biotech

**Description**:
"Enhanced hearing range with directional focusing and noise filtering. Integrates seamlessly with cochlear implant. Can detect whispered conversations at 50 meters."

**Lore Text**:
"The city has a secret soundtrack. Conversations you weren't meant to hear. Heartbeats that tell you when someone's lying. The auditory boost opens doors to information—and to paranoia you can never quite shake."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I heard my handler's heartbeat spike when she said the job was safe. Saved my life. Ruined my trust in everyone."* — Tier 6 courier, name withheld

---

### Thermal Vision (Tier 4 Required)
**Category**: Sensory / Vision Add-on
**Humanity Cost**: 5
**Manufacturer**: MilSpec Solutions

**Description**:
"Infrared overlay for optical systems. Detects heat signatures through walls, identifies recently-fired weapons, and tracks biological targets in zero visibility."

**Lore Text**:
"Originally military hardware—standard issue for corporate extraction teams. Now available to any courier with the credits. The city looks different in thermal. Everyone's a warm blob. Makes killing easier, they say. You're not shooting a person. Just a temperature gradient."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"Cold spots mean drones. Warm spots mean targets. I stopped thinking about the difference years ago."* — Anonymous, MilSpec training materials

**Manufacturer**: ArmorTech Industries

**Description**:
"Subdermal weave providing ballistic protection equivalent to Class II body armor. Installation covers torso and major limb surfaces. Visible scarring minimal with premium package."

**Lore Text**:
"Your skin becomes a product. You can feel bullets impact and not penetrate—a strange sensation that never becomes normal. The downside: you stop flinching. Your body forgets what fear feels like. That's when the real danger starts."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I took three rounds to the chest last week. Didn't break stride. My partner said I used to be more careful. I said I used to be more afraid."* — Courier performance review

---

### Reflex Boosters (Tier 4 Required)
**Category**: Physical / Speed
**Humanity Cost**: 12
**Manufacturer**: Apex Dynamics

**Description**:
"Spinal tap integration accelerating neural impulse speed. Reaction time improved by 40-60%. Side effects include difficulty sleeping and occasional involuntary muscle twitches."

**Lore Text**:
"The world slows down. Or you speed up—the philosophers argue about which. Combat becomes a dance where everyone else moves through honey. The crash comes later, when you're trying to have a normal conversation and your augmented reflexes keep anticipating attacks that aren't coming."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"My wife says I flinch when she tries to touch me. The boosters don't know the difference between a punch and a caress. Neither do I, anymore."* — Marriage counseling intake form

---

### Muscle Replacement (Tier 5 Required)
**Category**: Physical / Strength

**Manufacturer**: BioForge Systems

**Description**:
"Synthetic myomer fiber replacing organic muscle tissue. Strength increase of 200-300% depending on package. Full replacement recommended for optimal integration."

**Lore Text**:
"They remove your muscles. The ones you were born with, the ones that carried you through childhood. In their place: synthetic fibers that never tire, never cramp, never feel quite like your own. You can lift a car. You can crush a throat. You just can't remember what it felt like to be weak."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I hugged my mother after the surgery. Broke two of her ribs. The calibration was perfect. My humanity wasn't."* — Mandatory incident report

---

### Subdermal Weapon Mount (Tier 6 Required)
**Category**: Physical / Combat
**Humanity Cost**: 15
**Manufacturer**: MilSpec Solutions

**Description**:
"Concealed weapon system integrated into forearm structure. Standard loadout: monofilament blade or compact pistol. Deploys in 0.3 seconds."

**Lore Text**:
"The moment you install a weapon in your body, you become a weapon. Every handshake is a potential attack. Every gesture could be lethal. Security scanners see what you've become. So does everyone else, eventually."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I used to carry a gun for protection. Now I am the gun. The distinction matters more than you'd think."* — Chrome Saints initiation speech

## Utility Augmentations

### Internal Comm System (Tier 2 Required)
**Category**: Utility / Communication
**Humanity Cost**: 4
**Manufacturer**: Various

**Description**:
"Subvocal communication array allowing silent transmission. Integrates with standard networks. Encryption available at premium tiers."

**Lore Text**:
"You learn to talk without moving your lips. Useful for coordination, essential for survival. The downside: every thought becomes a potential broadcast. You develop a second internal voice—the one that speaks, and the one that doesn't. Sometimes you forget which is which."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I said 'I love you' to my handler instead of my wife. Subvocal mixup. Both relationships ended that day."* — Anonymous

---

### Environmental Seals (Tier 3 Required)
**Category**: Utility / Survival
**Humanity Cost**: 6
**Manufacturer**: BioForge Systems

**Description**:
"Respiratory and dermal modifications for hostile environment survival. Filters toxins, regulates temperature, provides 30 minutes of oxygen-independent operation."

**Lore Text**:
"The air in some parts of the city will kill you. Slowly, if you're lucky. The seals let you breathe anywhere—chemical spills, toxic waste zones, the lower maintenance tunnels where the Algorithm doesn't bother to maintain atmosphere. You become a closed system. Self-contained. Alone."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I can survive anywhere now. Toxins, radiation, vacuum. Everything except intimacy."* — Hazmat courier, psych evaluation

---

### Integrated Toolkit (Tier 4 Required)
**Category**: Utility / Technical
**Humanity Cost**: 8
**Manufacturer**: TechHands Ltd.

**Description**:
"Finger-mounted tool array including precision manipulators, interface jacks, and multi-spectrum scanner. Standard configuration replaces two fingers on dominant hand."

**Lore Text**:
"Your hands become the toolbox. Need a screwdriver? You have one. Interface with any port? Direct connection. The price: the fingers you were born with, the ones that learned to tie shoes and hold hands. The tools don't remember what they replaced."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I can repair anything now. Vehicles, augments, security systems. Everything except my relationship with my daughter, who cries when I try to hold her with these hands."* — Rosa Delgado's father, final interview before his death
