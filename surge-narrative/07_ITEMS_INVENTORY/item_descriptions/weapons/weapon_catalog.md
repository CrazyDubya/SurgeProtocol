## Holdout Weapons

### Compact Pistol
**Category**: Sidearm / Concealed
**Tier Available**: 1+
**Manufacturer**: Various

**Description**:
"Standard courier sidearm. Concealable, reliable, forgettable. The kind of weapon that doesn't attract attention until it needs to. Most couriers carry one. The smart ones never need to use it."

**Lore Text**:
"There's a saying in the Hollows: 'The gun you don't fire is the gun that saves your life.' A visible weapon invites challenge. A concealed one ends it."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I've carried the same compact for six years. Fired it twice. Both times, I wished I hadn't."* — Tier 7 courier, retirement interview

### Holdout Derringer
**Category**: Sidearm / Last Resort
**Tier Available**: 2+
**Manufacturer**: Street Fabrication

**Description**:
"Two shots. That's all you get. If you're using this, everything else has failed. Fits in a palm, a boot, the small of your back. The weapon of desperation and assassination."

**Lore Text**:
"Derringers are the weapon of people who've accepted they might die today. Two shots means you pick your targets carefully. Or you don't care what happens after."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"She pulled a derringer from her thigh holster. I had six shots left. She only needed one."* — Survivor's testimony, Incident Report 2054-1892

## Combat Pistols

### Service Automatic
**Category**: Sidearm / Standard
**Tier Available**: 3+
**Manufacturer**: Apex Dynamics

**Description**:
"Corporate security standard issue. Reliable, accurate, boring. Fifteen-round magazine, polymer frame, integrated smart-link for augmented targeting. The weapon of professionals who don't need to prove anything."

**Lore Text**:
"The service automatic is everywhere—security, couriers, criminals. When everyone carries the same weapon, the difference is who carries it better."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"My training officer said: 'The gun is always the same. You're the variable.' I understood that later, standing over someone who had the same weapon but less practice."* — Nakamura Security, orientation materials

---

### Heavy Revolver
**Category**: Sidearm / Power
**Tier Available**: 4+
**Manufacturer**: MilSpec Solutions

**Description**:
"Six rounds of stopping power. No smart-link, no electronics—just mechanical precision and excessive caliber. Favored by Chrome Saints and anyone who wants their presence felt before the first shot."

**Lore Text**:
"Revolvers are an aesthetic choice as much as a tactical one. They say: 'I don't need fifteen shots. I won't miss.' That confidence is either earned or fatal."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"The Chrome Saints call it 'The Sermon.' Because when it speaks, everyone listens."* — Gang violence analysis, Red Harbor Precinct

## Long Weapons

### Tactical Carbine
**Category**: Rifle / Versatile
**Tier Available**: 5+
**Manufacturer**: Apex Dynamics

**Description**:
"Modular platform accepting various configurations. Standard issue for extraction teams and high-tier security. Integrates with neural processors for enhanced targeting. The professional's choice for when things get serious."

**Lore Text**:
"The carbine is a statement: 'This is not a mugging. This is an operation.' Couriers who carry them are either very good or very scared. Sometimes both."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"Corporate extraction teams move in threes. Two carbines, one tech specialist. If you see that formation, you're either the target or the collateral."* — Ghost Network briefing materials

---

### Assault Shotgun
**Category**: Shotgun / Close Combat
**Tier Available**: 5+
**Manufacturer**: BioForge Systems

**Description**:
"Semi-automatic twelve-gauge with drum magazine. Devastating at close range, useless beyond it. The weapon of choice for corridor fighting and making statements."

**Lore Text**:
"Shotguns in a chrome city seem primitive. But chrome still dents. Synthetic muscle still tears. Some problems don't need precision—they need force."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"He brought a carbine to a hallway fight. I brought a shotgun. The hallway agreed with me."* — Chrome Saints enforcer, boasting (verified)

---

### Precision Rifle
**Category**: Rifle / Long Range
**Tier Available**: 6+
**Manufacturer**: MilSpec Solutions

**Description**:
"Designated marksman platform with variable zoom optics. Effective to 800 meters with augmented targeting. For when distance is the best protection and patience is the best weapon."

**Lore Text**:
"Snipers in the city work differently than in open war. Rooftop to rooftop. Window to window. The bullet crosses the gap between towers like a message that can't be ignored."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I never see the people I shoot. Just targets in a scope. The Algorithm calculates windage, distance, probability. I just squeeze the trigger. Is that better or worse? I've stopped asking."* — Anonymous, confession to Dr. Tanaka

## Melee Weapons

### Mono-Knife
**Category**: Blade / Standard
**Tier Available**: 2+
**Manufacturer**: Various

**Description**:
"Monomolecular edge capable of cutting through standard dermal armor. Silent, reliable, personal. The backup weapon that never runs out of ammunition."

**Lore Text**:
"Knives are intimate. You have to be close. You have to feel it. In a world of distance and disconnection, some people find that honesty compelling."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"My grandmother used a mono-knife to gut fish. I use one to survive. Same blade, different ocean."* — Hollows resident, philosophical

---

### Stun Baton

**Tier Available**: 2+
**Manufacturer**: Apex Dynamics

**Description**:
"Electroshock compliance tool. Incapacitates without permanent damage in most cases. Standard issue for security who need to ask questions afterward."

**Lore Text**:
"Non-lethal is a marketing term. The baton can stop a heart if you're not careful. Can scramble neural implants if you are. 'Less lethal' is more honest."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"They call it non-lethal. Tell that to the guy whose cortical stack got fried. He's alive. But which version of him woke up?"* — Union legal defense files

---

### Chrome Fist Augments
**Category**: Unarmed / Augmented
**Tier Available**: 4+
**Manufacturer**: BioForge Systems

**Description**:
"Reinforced hand structure with impact amplification. Your hands become weapons. Installation permanent, removal... complicated."

**Lore Text**:
"Once you can kill with your bare hands, you never feel unarmed. You also never feel entirely safe to touch anyone. The Chrome Saints love them. Relationship counselors fear them."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"I can punch through a car door. I broke my daughter's arm giving her a hug. The calibration was perfect. I wasn't."* — Chrome Saint member, seeking chrome removal

---

## Special Weapons

### EMP Grenade
**Category**: Thrown / Disabling
**Tier Available**: 5+
**Manufacturer**: Ghost Network (unlicensed)

**Description**:
"Electromagnetic pulse in throwable form. Fries unshielded electronics, disrupts augments, scrambles drone navigation. Illegal in corporate zones. Essential everywhere else."

**Lore Text**:
"The EMP is the great equalizer. Expensive chrome becomes dead weight. Drone swarms become falling debris. For a few seconds, everyone's human again."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"The corpo team came at us with everything—drones, smart weapons, neural links. One EMP and they were just people. Scared people."* — Union strike defense testimony

---

### Smart Weapon System
**Category**: Sidearm / Advanced
**Tier Available**: 7+
**Manufacturer**: Nakamura Biotech

**Description**:
"Gyrojet pistol with guided projectiles. Rounds track neural signatures, adjust trajectory mid-flight, penetrate cover. The Algorithm doesn't miss."

**Lore Text**:
"Smart weapons make everyone a marksman. They also make everyone trackable—each round logs its target. Nakamura knows who you've killed. They remember."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"The gun aimed itself. I just... authorized. Is that still killing? The Algorithm says no. It calls it 'optimized conflict resolution.' I don't sleep well either way."* — Corporate security, mandatory psych eval

---

### Plasma Cutter (Repurposed)
**Category**: Tool/Weapon / Industrial
**Tier Available**: 3+
**Manufacturer**: Industrial Salvage

**Description**:
"Industrial cutting tool modified for combat. Short range, devastating effect. Burns through armor, chrome, and flesh without distinction. Favored by desperate fighters and dock workers."

**Lore Text**:
"The plasma cutter was never designed as a weapon. That's what makes it terrifying. It doesn't wound—it removes. Parts of people just... aren't there anymore."

**Flavor Quote**:
*"Union workers used plasma cutters during the Harbor Strike. Management called it 'improvised weaponry.' Workers called it 'what we had.' The scars tell the same story either way."* — Strike documentary transcript
