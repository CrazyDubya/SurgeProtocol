# Tier 4 Job Templates

## Purpose
12 procedural job templates for Tier 4 couriers. Jobs become morally grayer, pay better, and carry higher stakes. The line between legal and illegal blurs.

PICKUP: Uptown service entrance
DROPOFF: Secure journalist contact
PACKAGE: Sealed evidence folder
DEADLINE: 2 hours
PAY: 220 credits
NOTES: Contents are above your clearance. Handle with extreme discretion.
```

### Flavor
**Pickup** (Corporate employee, nervous):
"This is everything. Years of evidence. If this reaches the right people... [Hands folder with shaking hands] Don't let them stop you. Please."

**Dropoff** (Journalist, guarded):
"You're the courier? [Examines seal] Intact. Good. This stays anonymous. Completely. You never saw me. I never saw you."

### Complications (35%)
- Corporate security patrol in pickup area
- Journalist's location changed last minute
- Tail suspected during transport

## JOB TEMPLATE 3: HARBOR SMUGGLING RUN

### Overview
**Tier**: 4
**Type**: Smuggling
**Urgency**: Time-critical
**Pay**: 200 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Captain Santos network
```
JOB: Port-to-Hollows Transfer
PICKUP: Esperanza (docked, limited window)
DROPOFF: Hollows distribution point
PACKAGE: Uncleared imports
DEADLINE: 30 minutes (ship departure imminent)
PAY: 200 credits
NOTES: Waterfront security heightened. Use alternate routes.
```

### Flavor
**Captain Santos**: "Cargo cleared water approach. Now it needs to clear land approach. Security's heavy—someone tipped them. Not about this shipment, but they're checking everything. Be creative."

**Dropoff Contact**: "[Receives package] This is medicine that would cost ten times more through legal channels. People will live because of what you just carried. Remember that when you question the work."

### Complications (40%)
- Security patrol timing changed
- Package heavier than expected
- Weather complicates outdoor segments

## JOB TEMPLATE 4: DATA BROKER DELIVERY

### Overview
**Tier**: 4
**Type**: Information transport
**Urgency**: Standard
**Pay**: 190 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Agent Nakahara
```
JOB: Encrypted Data Transport
PICKUP: [Coordinates only]
DROPOFF: [Coordinates only]
PACKAGE: Shielded data chip
DEADLINE: 3 hours
PAY: 190 credits
NOTES: Package is shielded against casual scans. Avoid intensive scanning.
```

### Flavor
**Pickup** (Anonymous):
*Dead drop. No human contact. Chip in marked container.*

**Dropoff** (Anonymous):
*Another dead drop. Leave chip, payment confirms automatically.*

**Internal Narration**: "You have no idea what's on this chip. That's deliberate. Knowledge is liability. Ignorance is protection. The system works if everyone plays their part."

### Complications (20%)
- Pickup location is in surveillance-heavy area
- Chip occasionally beeps (concerning but harmless)
- Dropoff location has loiterers (probably unrelated)

---

## JOB TEMPLATE 5: UNION DOCUMENTS

### Overview
**Tier**: 4
**Type**: Political
**Urgency**: Priority

DROPOFF: Multiple factory entrances
PACKAGE: Sealed pamphlets
DEADLINE: Before shift change (1 hour)
PAY: 140 credits
NOTES: Corporate security watches union activity. Discretion essential.
```

### Flavor
**Grace**: "These documents explain workers' rights. Legal documents. Completely legal. But corporations treat them like contraband. Funny how that works."

**Factory Worker** (receiving): "[Quickly takes package] Thank you. [Hides under coat] If the supervisors knew... but we need this. We need to know we have options."

### Complications (30%)
- Corporate security near one dropoff
- Multiple stops require time management
- One worker is too scared to accept (offer reassurance)

---

PICKUP: Off-grid pharmacy
DROPOFF: Underground clinic
PACKAGE: Temperature-controlled medications
DEADLINE: 90 minutes (cold chain critical)
PAY: 175 credits
NOTES: Medications are legitimate. Distribution channel is not.
```

### Flavor
**Pharmacy Contact**: "Insulin. Blood pressure medication. Antibiotics. All real, all effective, all priced out of reach for most people. This route gets them where they're needed."

**Clinic Staff**: "[Checks temperature] Still cold. Good. You just enabled a week of treatments. Patients who couldn't afford corporate pharmacies. Kids with infections. Elderly with chronic conditions."

### Complications (25%)
- Temperature sensor indicates marginal—speed matters
- Clinic location has moved (redirect message)
- Someone follows briefly (loses interest)

---

PACKAGE: Recovered technology
DEADLINE: 4 hours
PAY: 165 credits
NOTES: Facility ownership disputed. Entry may be contested.
```

### Flavor
**Instructions**: "Coordinates lead to old manufacturing plant. Ownership is in court—neither claimant is actively guarding it. That's our window. Third floor, maintenance bay, marked container."

**Salvage Dealer**: "Corporate castoffs. Still functional, just obsolete by their standards. By our standards? Perfectly useful. Recycling is green, right?"

### Complications (35%)
- Rival scavengers present (territorial)
- Structural instability (careful navigation)
- Ownership's security makes sweep (timing matters)

---

PICKUP: Harbor food stall
DROPOFF: Media outlet office
PACKAGE: Sealed envelope
DEADLINE: End of business day
PAY: 150 credits
NOTES: Contents unknown to me. Just delivery.
```

### Flavor
**Manny**: "Someone wants this to reach the press. Could be scandal, could be nothing. I don't open sealed envelopes—that's how I stay trustworthy. Get it there."

**Media Office Receptionist**: "[Takes envelope] Anonymous tips. We get dozens. Most are nothing. Occasionally... [Weighs it] Occasionally they change everything. Thanks, courier."

### Complications (15%)
- Media office is busy (wait required)
- Someone asks what's in the envelope (decline to answer)

```
JOB: Ownership-Disputed Item Transport
PICKUP: Storage facility
DROPOFF: New claimant
PACKAGE: Contested merchandise
DEADLINE: 3 hours
PAY: 185 credits
NOTES: Previous owner disagrees with current ownership determination. Ignore their objections.
```

### Flavor
**Storage Clerk**: "[Hands package] Release authorization verified. What the original owner thinks about it isn't my problem. Or yours."

**New Owner**: "Finally. This was stolen from my family twenty years ago. The thief 'legally purchased' it, of course. Courts failed. You didn't."

*Note: Which party is telling the truth is deliberately ambiguous.*

### Complications (30%)
- Previous owner appears, demands package back
- Claims and counterclaims create moral uncertainty

PICKUP: Sender location
DROPOFF: Recipient location
PACKAGE: Sealed physical message
DEADLINE: 2 hours
PAY: 160 credits
NOTES: Digital channels compromised. Physical delivery required.
```

### Flavor
**Sender** (paranoid): "They're watching everything electronic. Every message, every call. But they can't intercept a piece of paper being walked across town. Not yet."

**Recipient** (reads, burns message): "Thank you. This changes... a great deal. [Watches paper burn] Some information should never exist digitally."

### Complications (20%)
- Sender is being watched (leave without suspicion)

PICKUP: [Unlisted location]
DROPOFF: [Unlisted location]
PACKAGE: [Unlisted contents]
DEADLINE: 4 hours
PAY: 300 credits
NOTES: Triple pay. Triple discretion. Volunteer only.
```

### Flavor
**Gray Whitfield**: "I have a job. It pays triple. Contents are above your clearance—deliberately. If you can't handle uncertainty, decline. If you can... you'll be well-compensated."

**Pickup**: Silent exchange. Heavy package. No words.

**Dropoff**: Silent exchange. Payment confirms. No words.

**Internal**: "You carried something. You don't know what. You were paid well. Maybe ignorance really is bliss. Maybe it's just complicity with extra steps."

### Complications (45%)
- Package makes sounds (ignore them)
- Feeling of being followed (may or may not be real)
- Moral uncertainty throughout

---
