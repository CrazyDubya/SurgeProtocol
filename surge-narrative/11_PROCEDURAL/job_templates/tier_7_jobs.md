## JOB 1: THE FACTION BRIEFCASE

### Template
**Client**: [FACTION_REPRESENTATIVE]
**Type**: Intelligence courier
**Package**: Sealed briefcase, contents unknown
**Destination**: Opposing faction safe house
**Payment**: 2,500 credits + faction favor

### Briefing
"This briefcase contains our response to recent... overtures. The contents are sensitive. You don't need to know specifics—plausible deniability protects you. What you need to know: delivery confirms we're open to negotiation. Non-delivery signals hostility. No pressure."

### Complications
- Both factions watching for this delivery
- Corporate interests want to intercept
- Package may contain something player would object to if opened
- Time window: must arrive before midnight or message changes meaning

### Dialogue Variants

**Convergence Client**:
"The Resistance has asked for proof of good faith. This briefcase is that proof. Deliver it intact, unopened. What's inside is... a gesture. Understanding begins with trust."

**Resistance Client**:
"Convergence leadership claims they want dialogue. This briefcase is our test. If it arrives safely, maybe they mean it. If it disappears... we'll know they're monitoring our communications."

### Outcome Implications
- Successful delivery: Faction relations improve
- Failed delivery: Faction relations worsen
- Opened package: Trust broken with client
- Intercepted: Both factions blame player

## JOB 2: THE CORPORATE DEFECTOR

### Template
**Client**: [CORPORATE_INSIDER]
**Type**: Person transport
**Package**: The client themselves
**Destination**: Safe house outside corporate reach
**Payment**: 3,000 credits + information

### Briefing
"I'm the package. I need to disappear. Nakamura security is already looking for me. In twelve hours, I'll be officially 'detained for questioning.' That detention doesn't end well. Get me out of the city. I'll pay anything."

### Complications
- Corporate security actively searching
- Client has tracking chrome that must be disabled
- Safe house location known only to underground contacts
- Deadline: Must be clear before morning security sweep

### Dialogue Variants

**Nervous Defector**:
"I thought I was doing important work. Then I saw what 'important' meant to them. [Shows encrypted data chip] This is my insurance. If something happens to me, it goes public. Help me live long enough to decide whether that's necessary."

**Calm Defector**:
"I've been planning this for months. Every contingency mapped. But maps don't move bodies. I need your skills to turn plans into reality. Follow my instructions exactly, and we both survive."

### Outcome Implications
- Successful extraction: Information rewards later
- Captured during extraction: Player reputation damaged, defector lost
- Client killed: Serious consequences, insurance data triggers

## JOB 3: THE EVIDENCE RUN

### Template
**Client**: [JOURNALIST/WHISTLEBLOWER]
**Type**: Evidence delivery
**Package**: Physical proof of corporate crimes
**Destination**: Independent media outlet, underground
**Payment**: 1,500 credits (funded by collective)

### Briefing
"This package contains proof. Not allegations—proof. Environmental contamination affecting 50,000 people. Nakamura internal memos showing they knew. Medical records they tried to destroy. Someone needs to publish this. The legitimate media won't touch corporate cases. But the underground press will—if you can get it to them."

### Complications
- Multiple parties want this evidence destroyed
- Legitimate press has been compromised/threatened
- Underground outlet location is need-to-know
- Evidence is fragile—degradation risk

### Dialogue Variants

**Desperate Whistleblower**:
"I've been carrying this for six months. Waiting for the right moment. Every day I hold it is another day they might find me. Please. People are dying while this stays hidden."

**Professional Journalist**:
"I've been on this story for two years. The sources have finally given me what I need. But I can't be seen delivering it—they're watching me. You're my cutout. My final link in the chain."

### Outcome Implications
- Successful delivery: Story breaks, corporate reputation damaged
- Failed delivery: Evidence lost, coverup succeeds
- Traced to source: Whistleblower endangered

---

## JOB 4: THE ALGORITHM SAMPLE

### Template
**Client**: [RESEARCH_AGENT]
**Type**: Biological/Technical transport
**Package**: Algorithm hardware sample (extracted)
**Destination**: Independent research facility
**Payment**: 4,000 credits + research access

### Briefing
"This sample was extracted from a willing donor—their old integration hardware, post-upgrade. It contains Algorithm code and biological interface data. Both Convergence and corporations consider this proprietary. We consider it essential for independent study. Can you move it without either side knowing?"

### Complications
- Sample requires specific storage conditions
- Both factions have detection methods for Algorithm hardware
- Research facility is hidden, location changes regularly
- Donor may be traced through sample

### Dialogue Variants

**Academic Client**:
"The Algorithm is the most significant technology ever created—and the least understood. Independent research is forbidden by those who control it. This sample could answer questions they don't want asked."

**Medical Client**:
"People integrate without understanding what they're accepting. This sample could help us provide informed consent—real informed consent, based on independent analysis. That's worth protecting."

### Outcome Implications
- Successful delivery: Research advances, future revelations
- Sample degraded: Partial information only
- Intercepted: Source exposed, research set back

---

## JOB 5: THE TREATY DRAFT

### Template
**Client**: [DIPLOMATIC_INTERMEDIARY]
**Type**: Document delivery (multi-party)
**Package**: Working treaty between factions
**Destination**: Multiple parties for signature
**Payment**: 2,000 credits per stop (3-4 stops)

### Briefing
"You're about to carry history. This document represents months of secret negotiation. A framework for coexistence between Convergence and Resistance. Each signatory must receive the same copy, sign, and return it before the window closes. You're not just delivering paper—you're delivering possibility."

### Complications
- Multiple deliveries must happen in sequence
- Each signatory may attempt to modify the document
- Hardliners on both sides want the treaty to fail
- Time pressure: all signatures needed within 24 hours

### Dialogue Variants

**Ambassador Yoshida**:
"This treaty isn't perfect. No treaty ever is. But it creates space for dialogue where none existed. Every hour it exists unsigned is another hour someone might sabotage it. Speed matters."

**Resistance Signatory**:
"[Signs] I'm not sure this is wise. But I'm sure continued conflict is unwise. Sometimes you bet on peace even when war seems safer."

**Convergence Signatory**:
"[Signs] The Algorithm shows us that connection is inevitable. This treaty is a step toward that truth. Even if the Resistance doesn't understand that yet."

### Outcome Implications
- All signatures obtained: Treaty enacted, major story impact
- Partial signatures: Treaty weakened but possible
- Treaty sabotaged: Conflict intensifies

## JOB 6: THE CONTESTED INHERITANCE

### Template
**Client**: [LEGAL_REPRESENTATIVE]
**Type**: Asset recovery
**Package**: Physical inheritance items (contested)
**Destination**: Court-designated neutral storage
**Payment**: 3,500 credits (estate funds)

### Briefing
"The deceased was wealthy and complicated. Multiple parties claim inheritance—biological family, fork, corporate beneficiaries, charitable trusts. The physical assets have been... scattered during disputes. Your job is to recover specific items and bring them to neutral custody before the court date. Sounds simple. It isn't."

### Complications
- Multiple claimants may attempt to "secure" items first
- Some items held in hostile locations
- Legal authority unclear—couriers may be challenged
- Items have sentimental value beyond monetary worth

### Dialogue Variants

**Biological Family Representative**:
"These items belonged to our father. Not his fork. Not his corporation. His family. The law may be ambiguous but morality isn't. Help us recover what's ours."

**Fork Representative**:
"I have my original's memories. His attachments. His love for these objects. The biological family sees items. I see my life's meaningful artifacts. Who has the stronger claim?"

### Outcome Implications
- All items recovered: Court can rule fairly
- Items missing/damaged: Claims compromised
- Player takes sides: Reputation with one party, enmity with others

---

## JOB 7: THE SILENT EXTRACTION

### Template
**Client**: [INTELLIGENCE_CONTACT]
**Type**: Person extraction (unwilling subject)
**Package**: Target individual to be relocated
**Destination**: Debriefing facility
**Payment**: 5,000 credits (highest risk category)

### Briefing
"The target knows things. Things that affect everyone's security. They won't come willingly—they're comfortable where they are, protected by powerful interests. Your job is to extract them quietly. Not kidnapping—we have legal authority. But the authority they're under won't recognize that authority. Complicated enough?"

### Complications
- Target may resist or call for help
- Protective detail must be avoided
- Legal authority technically valid but politically contested
- Target may offer counter-payment to be released

### Dialogue Variants

**Intelligence Contact**:
"This person has information about upcoming threats. They're refusing to share—misguided loyalty. We need to have a longer conversation with them. Your job ends at delivery. What happens after isn't your concern."

**Target (During Extraction)**:
"You don't know who you're working for. This 'extraction' is a power grab. Let me go and I'll double whatever they're paying. [Desperate] I know things they want buried. Things everyone should know."

### Outcome Implications
- Successful extraction: Intelligence gained (or silenced)
- Target released: Consequences vary based on target's claims
- Extraction fails publicly: Major reputation damage

---

## JOB 8: THE MEMORY COURIER

### Template
**Client**: [PERSONAL_CLIENT]
**Type**: Memory storage transport
**Package**: Physical memory backup device
**Destination**: Secure storage facility
**Payment**: 2,000 credits + gratitude

### Briefing
"This device contains my memories. All of them. My entire life backed up. I'm about to undergo a risky procedure. If something goes wrong, this backup is all that remains of who I was. I need it stored somewhere safe—somewhere neither corporations nor factions control. Can you ensure my backup survives even if I don't?"

### Complications
- Memory backups are legally ambiguous property
- Multiple parties might want to access/destroy memories
- Storage facility requires verification of client's wishes
- Client may not survive—then what?

### Dialogue Variants

**Dying Client**:
"I've lived a full life. But I've also lived a complicated one. This backup contains truths I've kept secret. I want them preserved—not for release, just preserved. Future generations might find them valuable. Or cautionary."

**Cautious Client**:
"I'm not dying—at least, I don't plan to. But I've seen what happens to people who don't prepare. If the worst happens, this backup proves who I was. Maybe it helps someone rebuild me. Maybe it just stands as memorial. Either way—it matters to me."

### Outcome Implications
- Backup secured: Client's wishes honored
- Backup accessed: Privacy violated
- Backup lost: Client's identity potentially lost forever

## JOB 9: THE FACTION BALANCE

### Template
**Client**: [NEUTRAL_ARBITER]
**Type**: Parallel delivery (balanced)
**Package**: Equivalent assets to both factions
**Destination**: Both faction headquarters simultaneously
**Payment**: 3,000 credits (neutral funds)

### Briefing
"I'm distributing resources to maintain balance. Both factions receive equivalent supplies—neither side gains advantage. Your job is to ensure both deliveries happen simultaneously. If one side receives first, they might use the window to act against the other. Precision timing is essential."

### Complications
- Two locations, one courier
- Both factions may try to delay the other's delivery
- Timing must be perfect—within minutes
- Either side may try to intercept the other's package

### Dialogue Variants

**Neutral Arbiter**:
"Peace requires balance. Neither side trusts the other to receive resources fairly. So I provide—and you deliver—equally. Any imbalance, any appearance of favoritism, and the fragile equilibrium breaks."

**Faction Representative (Either Side)**:
"The balance system is a fiction. They get the same resources but use them differently. We build; they stockpile. Fairness isn't sameness. [Pause] But I'll play along. For now."

### Outcome Implications
- Balanced delivery: Peace maintained
- Imbalanced: Suspicion increases, possible retaliation
- Intercepted: Balance broken, blame assigned

---

## JOB 10: THE FINAL MESSAGE

### Template
**Client**: [TERMINAL_CLIENT]
**Type**: Message delivery
**Package**: Recorded final message
**Destination**: Multiple recipients (family, associates, public)
**Payment**: 500 credits (emotional, not financial, weight)

### Briefing
"I'm dying. I have time to prepare, which is more than many get. I've recorded messages for the people who mattered in my life. Each one tailored. Each one final. I need someone to deliver them after I'm gone. Not before—that would make it too real. After. Can you carry someone's final words?"

### Complications
- Emotional weight of death-related delivery
- Some recipients may not want the message
- Messages may contain uncomfortable truths
- Timing: after death confirmation, before too much time passes

### Dialogue Variants

**Dying Courier (Old Elite)**:
"I ran these streets for thirty years. Delivered packages that changed everything. Now my final delivery... is myself. My last words to everyone who shaped my life. Some will be grateful. Some will be hurt. All deserve to hear what I couldn't say while living."

**Terminal Client (Non-Courier)**:
"We never say what we should say. Always 'later,' always 'someday.' I'm out of somedays. These messages are everything I should have said and didn't. Please make sure they arrive."

### Outcome Implications
- Messages delivered: Closure for recipients
- Messages refused: Some pain can't be healed
- Messages suppressed: Truth dies with the sender

---

## PROCEDURAL GENERATION GUIDELINES

### Client Mixing
- Any client type with any package type creates variety
- Complications can stack (2-3 per job for Tier 7)
- Payment scales with risk and complication count

### Moral Weight
- All Tier 7 jobs have consequences
- No purely "clean" options
- Player choices define reputation

### Faction Integration
- Jobs can favor, hurt, or balance factions
- Long-term patterns affect endgame options
- No job is truly neutral
