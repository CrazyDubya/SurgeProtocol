## PICKUP CIRCUMSTANCES

### Standard Pickups

#### 1. Counter Service
**Tier**: 0-4
**Description**: Walk up, show code, receive package.

**Scene**: A counter. A bored worker. The transaction takes thirty seconds.

**Dialogue**:
- "You the courier? Sign here. Or don't. I don't actually care."
- "Package for [CODE]. That's you? Take it. Next!"
- "Finally. Been waiting to get this off my desk. Here."

**Complications**: None typical. Occasionally wrong package given.

---

#### 2. Dead Drop
**Tier**: 2-5
**Description**: Package left at location. No human contact.

**Scene**: An alley, a locker, a hidden compartment. The package waits.

**Flavor Text**:
- The locker opens with the code. Inside: one package, no note.
- Behind the dumpster, exactly where they said. Wrapped in plastic against the rain.
- The brick comes loose. Behind it, the package. Someone was here recently—the dust is disturbed.

**Complications**: Possible surveillance. Possible trap. Possible wrong package.

---

#### 3. Moving Pickup
**Tier**: 3-6
**Description**: Client is mobile. Intercept required.

**Scene**: A crowd, a moving vehicle, a narrow window of opportunity.

**Flavor Text**:
- The target walks fast. You match pace. Brush contact. Package transferred. Keep walking.
- The vehicle slows but doesn't stop. Window rolls down. Catch. Window up. Gone.
- Three seconds of overlap. They're heading north, you're heading south. Now.

**Complications**: Timing critical. Witnesses. Possible pursuit.

---

#### 4. Paranoid Client
**Tier**: 3-6
**Description**: Client needs convincing before handoff.

**Scene**: Nervous eyes. Multiple verification steps. Trust is earned.

**Dialogue**:
- "Show me your hands. Slowly. Now the code phrase. What color was the sky in Budapest?"
- "I've changed locations twice. You found me both times. Either you're good or you're tracking me. Prove which."
- "Before I give you this—who sent you? Exactly. Every word. I'll know if you lie."

**Complications**: Extended time at location. Possible abort if trust fails.

---

#### 5. Front Business
**Tier**: 2-5
**Description**: Package retrieved from legitimate-seeming business.

**Scene**: A shop, a restaurant, an office. Normal on the surface.

**Dialogue**:
- "You want the... specialty order? In the back. Through that door. Don't touch anything."
- "I have a reservation. Table for none. Under the name 'urgent.'"
- "I'm here for the thing. You know the thing." [Beat] "...the dry cleaning. Yes."

**Complications**: Maintain cover. Possible legitimate customers as witnesses.

---

### High-Risk Pickups

#### 6. Hostile Territory
**Tier**: 4-6
**Description**: Pickup location is dangerous. Speed essential.

**Scene**: Gang territory. Corporate patrol zone. Somewhere you shouldn't be.

**Flavor Text**:
- Eyes follow you from doorways. Don't run. Don't look scared. Get in, get out, get gone.
- The security drone passes overhead. You have forty seconds until the next sweep.
- The colors on the wall tell you whose territory you've entered. The package better be worth it.

**Complications**: Combat possible. Pursuit likely. Timer implicit.

---

#### 7. Ambush Risk
**Tier**: 4-6
**Description**: Someone else wants this package. They're waiting.

**Scene**: The handoff spot feels wrong. Too quiet. Too exposed.

**Flavor Text**:
- Your Algorithm (or instincts) screams. Something's off. The shadows have too many bodies.
- The client's expression shifts from relief to terror. They're looking behind you.
- "Change of plans. Meet me—" The call cuts out. Static. Then a different voice: "They won't make it."

**Complications**: Combat guaranteed. Client may be compromised. Trust no one.

---

#### 8. Emergency Extraction
**Tier**: 5-7
**Description**: Client needs to leave WITH the package. Now.

**Scene**: Chaos. Gunfire. Screaming. A door opening and someone shoving a package at you.

**Dialogue**:
- "Take it and run! Don't wait for me—just GO!"
- "They breached. I'm uploading what I can—physical backup is yours. Don't let it end here."
- "Fifteen seconds until they cut power. Twelve. Ten. TAKE IT AND MOVE."

**Complications**: Immediate pursuit. Client fate unknown. Timer critical.

---

#### 9. Interstitial Adjacent
**Tier**: 6-8
**Description**: Pickup location exists between spaces.

**Scene**: The address leads nowhere. Then somewhere. Then... here?

**Flavor Text**:
- The door shouldn't open onto this. The room shouldn't exist. The package floats mid-air.
- You blink and the pickup point materializes. You blink again and you're holding the package. The location was never there.
- The walls breathe. The floor isn't solid. Something hands you the package without having hands.

**Complications**: Reality is optional. Return route may not exist. Sanity check.

---

#### 10. Algorithm Mediated
**Tier**: 5-8
**Description**: Your Algorithm arranges the pickup. Trust required.

**Scene**: Following directions that only exist in your head.

**Flavor Text**:
- ALGORITHM: "Turn left. Stop. Wait. Now reach into that maintenance panel." You do. Package.
- Your vision overlays pickup instructions onto reality. The world becomes a waypoint system.
- You don't remember walking here. But here you are. Package in hand. Time elapsed: unknown.

**Complications**: Trust your Algorithm (or don't). Gaps in memory. Observer uncertainty.

---

## ROUTE CIRCUMSTANCES

### Environmental Factors

#### 11. Traffic Nightmare
**Tier**: All
**Description**: Normal routes clogged. Alternatives required.

**Flavor Text**:
- Gridlock. Every vehicle stopped. The only way through is on foot—between the cars.
- Construction reroutes everything through the same three streets. Timer's ticking.
- Protest blocking the main thoroughfare. Join them, go around, or go through.

**Solutions**: Alternative routes, roof running, patient waiting.

---

#### 12. Weather Event
**Tier**: All
**Description**: Environmental conditions complicate travel.

**Flavor Text**:
- Rain turns the streets to rivers. Temperature-sensitive package. No shelter on the direct route.
- Fog so thick you can taste it. Navigation by memory only. Or Algorithm.
- The wind's strong enough to knock you off a roof. Maybe take the street today.

**Solutions**: Adjust route, protect package, accept delay.

---

#### 13. Security Checkpoint
**Tier**: 2-6
**Description**: Unexpected checkpoint on your route.

**Flavor Text**:
- Corporate security. Random inspection. The package will not pass casual scrutiny.
- Police presence. Someone important is moving through. Everyone gets scanned.
- District lockdown. No one in or out without clearance. You don't have clearance.

**Solutions**: Alternative route, bluff through, wait out, bribe.

---

#### 14. Gang Presence
**Tier**: 2-6
**Description**: Territory dispute affects your route.

**Flavor Text**:
- Two factions staring each other down. The street between them is your only route.
- Colors everywhere. Challenge calls from doorways. You're noticed.
- Fresh tags over old ones. Territory changed hands recently. Who controls this block today?

**Solutions**: Pay toll, request passage, find alternate route, run fast.

---

#### 15. Structural Hazard
**Tier**: 2-6
**Description**: The built environment is actively dangerous.

**Flavor Text**:
- Building collapse. Recent. Dust still settling. Your route goes through—went through—here.
- Fire in a residential block. Emergency services blocking everything. Smoke makes shortcuts dangerous.
- Infrastructure failure. Sparking wires, flooded sublevels, unstable walkways.

**Solutions**: Dangerous shortcut, long detour, wait for clearance.

---

### Active Threats

#### 16. Rival Courier
**Tier**: 2-5
**Description**: Someone else wants to deliver first. Or steal yours.

**Flavor Text**:
- You recognize them. Jin? No. Someone faster. Racing the same route.
- "Hey! That package is mine!" It isn't. But they're not asking.
- Parallel path. Same destination. First one there gets paid. Or maybe just one of you gets there at all.

**Solutions**: Outrun, outfight, or negotiate split.

---

#### 17. Corporate Tail
**Tier**: 4-7
**Description**: Someone's following. Professionally.

**Flavor Text**:
- Too many coincidences. Same face at three different turns. They're on you.
- The drone isn't city surveillance. It's following you specifically. Tag on the package?
- Earpiece chatter you're not supposed to hear. Your location, broadcast. Every thirty seconds.

**Solutions**: Lose them, confront them, or lead them wrong.

---

#### 18. Active Pursuit
**Tier**: 4-7
**Description**: They're not following anymore. They're chasing.

**Flavor Text**:
- Footsteps behind you. Multiple. Getting closer.
- Engine roar. Motorcycle. No—two. Gaining fast.
- ALGORITHM: "Evasion pattern recommended. They have visual. Combat probability increasing."

**Solutions**: Run, fight, hide, or find backup.

---

#### 19. Interception Attempt
**Tier**: 5-7
**Description**: They're ahead of you. Waiting.

**Flavor Text**:
- Roadblock. Not official. Three figures. One gestures for you to stop.
- The only exit from this alley is blocked. They were already here.
- "We don't want trouble. Just the package. Walk away."

**Solutions**: Negotiate, fight through, or find unexpected exit.

---

#### 20. System Failure
**Tier**: 4-8
**Description**: Your augments/equipment malfunction mid-route.

**Flavor Text**:
- HUD flickers. Navigation goes dark. You're blind in unfamiliar territory.
- Algorithm: "ERROR. ERROR. RECALIBRATING. STAND BY—" Then silence.
- Your legs stop working. Just for a moment. Augment glitch. The moment lasts forever.

**Solutions**: Manual navigation, emergency reboot, abort.

---

## DROPOFF CIRCUMSTANCES

### Standard Dropoffs

#### 21. Clean Handoff
**Tier**: All
**Description**: Simple exchange. No complications.

**Scene**: Professional recipient. Quick exchange. Done.

**Dialogue**:
- "You're the courier? Good. Payment's transferred. We never met."

**Complications**: None. This is the good version.

---

#### 22. Grateful Recipient
**Tier**: 0-3
**Description**: This delivery really mattered to someone.

**Scene**: Relief, tears, gratitude. Sometimes the job means something.

**Dialogue**:
- "Thank god. Thank you. I didn't know if—thank you. This is everything."
- "You saved my business. My family. I know that sounds dramatic but... thank you."
- "My daughter's going to be okay now. Because of you. Whatever they're paying you, take this too."

**Complications**: Emotional weight. Possible overpayment from gratitude.

---

#### 23. Dead Drop Delivery
**Tier**: 2-6
**Description**: Leave package. No human contact.

**Scene**: A location. A signal. Walk away.

**Flavor Text**:
- Leave it in the marked container. Don't wait. Don't look back. Payment arrives remotely.
- The wall panel opens when you approach. Place package. Panel closes. Done.
- No one's here. That's the point. Leave it exactly where specified. Walk away. Trust the process.

**Complications**: Can't verify receipt. Payment depends on trust.

---

### Complicated Dropoffs

#### 24. Inspection Required
**Tier**: 3-6
**Description**: Recipient wants to verify before paying.

**Scene**: Scrutiny. Tests. Waiting.

**Dialogue**:
- "I'll need to verify authenticity. Wait here. This may take a moment."
- "Before I accept this—I need to check for tampering. Protocol. You understand."
- "Open it. No, not here. In the scanner room. I need to see what I'm buying."

**Complications**: May reveal package contents. Possible rejection if damaged.

---

#### 25. Changed Terms
**Tier**: 3-6
**Description**: Recipient wants to renegotiate at delivery.

**Scene**: Suddenly, the deal's different.

**Dialogue**:
- "About the payment... circumstances have changed. I can offer half. Take it or take the package back."
- "My employer is no longer interested. But I am. Personally. At a different price."
- "I need more. One more delivery. Then full payment. You're already here. What's one more stop?"

**Complications**: Negotiation needed. May require walking away.

---

#### 26. Wrong Recipient
**Tier**: 2-5
**Description**: Someone else claims the package.

**Scene**: Confusion. Competing claims. Who's real?

**Dialogue**:
- "That's mine." [Different person arrives] "No, that's MINE. Who's this?"
- "The code you gave me is wrong. But I'm definitely the recipient. The client changed codes."
- "I'll take that." [Your instincts say this isn't right. But they know the details.]

**Complications**: Verify identity. Possible setup. Trust issues.

---

#### 27. Ambush on Arrival
**Tier**: 4-7
**Description**: The dropoff is a trap.

**Scene**: They weren't waiting for a package. They were waiting for you.

**Flavor Text**:
- The door opens to armed figures. The recipient is bound in the corner. "Ah, the courier. Right on time."
- No one's here. That's wrong. Then—movement. Everywhere.
- ALGORITHM: "THREAT DETECTED. MULTIPLE HOSTILES. DROPOFF COMPROMISED. RECOMMEND—" [Signal jammed]

**Complications**: Combat. Capture risk. Package may be bait.

---

#### 28. Recipient in Distress
**Tier**: 3-6
**Description**: The recipient needs help beyond the delivery.

**Scene**: This is more than a job now.

**Dialogue**:
- "You have to help me. The package—forget the package. They're coming. Please."
- "Delivery complete. But courier—stay. I need a witness. For what happens next."
- "Thank you for the delivery. Now... can you deliver me? Same destination principles. I'll pay extra."

**Complications**: Moral choice. Additional unplanned tasks. Time investment.

---

#### 29. No-Show
**Tier**: 2-5
**Description**: Recipient doesn't appear.

**Scene**: Waiting. Waiting. Nothing.

**Flavor Text**:
- The window expires. No one arrives. Package still in your hands. Now what?

**Complications**: Contact client. Find alternative recipient. Return package.

---

#### 30. Transcendent Delivery
**Tier**: 7-8
**Description**: The recipient isn't human. Or isn't anymore.

**Scene**: Beyond normal parameters. Something else receives.

**Flavor Text**:
- The upload terminal accepts the package. A voice—not voice—acknowledges receipt. Payment confirmed.
- You place the package on the altar. The Interstitial absorbs it. Something like gratitude resonates.
- The Algorithm representation materializes, takes the package, nods. "CONTINUATION ASSURED. GRATITUDE: EXPRESSED."

**Complications**: Existential weight. Reality negotiable. Changed perspective.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Selection by Tier
- Tier 0-2: Circumstances 1-3, 11-12, 21-23 (safe, simple)
- Tier 3-4: Add 4-5, 13-15, 24-26 (complications introduced)
- Tier 5-6: Add 6-8, 16-18, 27-28 (active threats)
- Tier 7-8: All circumstances available including 9-10, 19-20, 29-30

### Probability Weighting
- 60% standard circumstances
- 30% complicated circumstances
- 10% high-risk circumstances
- Adjust by tier (higher tiers = more complications)

### Combination Logic
- Easy pickup + hard route + easy dropoff = recoverable challenge
- Hard pickup + easy route + hard dropoff = tension at endpoints
- Hard + hard + hard = reserved for major jobs only
