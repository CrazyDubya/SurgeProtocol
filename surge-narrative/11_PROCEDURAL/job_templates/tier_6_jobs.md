# Tier 6 Job Templates

## Purpose
12 procedural job templates for Tier 6 couriers. The Fork era—identity fractures, consciousness splits, and every delivery involves questions of who is real, who is original, who has the right to exist. Jobs here are philosophically challenging and emotionally complex.

---

## JOB TEMPLATE 1: FORK CORRESPONDENCE

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Personal/Identity
**Urgency**: Standard
**Pay**: 320 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Dr. Vance (fork counselor) or private client
```
JOB: Fork-to-Original Communication
PICKUP: Fork's residence
DROPOFF: Original's residence
PACKAGE: Sealed personal correspondence
DEADLINE: Flexible
PAY: 320 credits
NOTE: Fork and Original are not speaking directly. This may be their only communication.
```

### Pickup Flavor
**Fork**: "I need to reach... myself. The other myself. The original. [Hands letter] We haven't spoken since the split. Too strange. Too painful. But this needs to be said. Even if they won't respond. Even if they can't forgive me for existing."

### Transit Weight
*You're carrying words from someone to themselves. From a person to the person they used to be. Or still are. Or something between.*

### Dropoff Flavor
**Original** (varied reactions):
- "From my fork? [Hesitates] I don't know if I can read this."
- "Finally. I've been wondering what they think about... all of this."
- "They want to talk now? After everything?"

**Player Options**:
- "They seemed sincere." (supportive)
- "Just delivering, not mediating." (neutral)
- "Whatever happened between you, this letter matters to them." (gentle push)
- [Silent delivery]

### Complications (20%)
- Original refuses delivery initially
- Fork has second thoughts (retrieval attempt)
- Location of one party has changed

### Hidden Flag
`FORK_CORRESPONDENCE_FACILITATED` - Affects fork reconciliation storylines.

## JOB TEMPLATE 2: CUSTODY EVIDENCE

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Legal/Emotional
**Urgency**: Priority
**Pay**: 380 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Legal contact (Mira Okonkwo) or private
```
JOB: Legal Document Delivery
PICKUP: Law office
DROPOFF: Arbitration chamber
PACKAGE: Fork custody case evidence
DEADLINE: Before hearing
PAY: 380 credits
NOTE: This case decides which consciousness gets to keep being a parent.
```

### Context
A fork custody dispute: who gets to be the parent? The original who remembers raising the children, or the fork who shares those memories and feels the same love?

### Pickup Flavor
**Lawyer**: "The Henderson case. [Hands documents] Both consciousness claim parenthood. Both have the memories. Both love the children equally. But you can't have two mothers at every school event. Someone has to win. Someone has to lose. [Sighs] I hate these cases."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Arbitration Clerk**: "The Henderson evidence. [Files] Third custody case this month. Courts weren't designed for this. None of us were. [To player] You ever think about what happens when you can just... make more of yourself? What that does to families? To love?"

### Complications (25%)
- Opposing party tries to intercept
- Evidence contains emotionally disturbing testimony
- Arbitration location changed (security measure)

### Hidden Flag
`FORK_CUSTODY_CASE` - Minor story flag.

DROPOFF: Merge candidates
PACKAGE: Merge preparation materials + final instructions
DEADLINE**: Before merge window
PAY**: 350 credits
NOTE**: Two people are about to become one. This helps them prepare.
```

### Pickup Flavor
**Facility Tech**: "Merge protocols for the Vasquez pair. [Packages carefully] Consciousness synchronization guides, neural mapping results, integration timelines. In 48 hours, there won't be two of them anymore. There'll be one new person made of both. This is their last preparation."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Merge Candidates** (holding hands, nervous, peaceful):
**Person A**: "This is it. Everything we need."
**Person B**: "After tomorrow, we won't be 'we' anymore. We'll be 'I.'"
**Person A**: "[To player] Are we crazy? Giving up ourselves to become something new?"
**Person B**: "We're not giving up. We're combining. Expanding. Together."

**Player Options**:
- "It sounds beautiful." (supportive)
- "It sounds terrifying." (honest)
- "I don't understand it. But you seem at peace." (accepting)

## JOB TEMPLATE 4: FORK DISPUTE ARBITRATION

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Legal/Identity
**Urgency**: Priority
**Pay**: 360 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: The Judge (legal authority) or legal network
```
JOB: Multi-Party Evidence Delivery
PICKUP: Three sources (Original, Fork A, Fork B)
DROPOFF: Arbitration chamber
PACKAGE: Evidence from all parties in identity dispute
DEADLINE: Before hearing
PAY: 360 credits
NOTE: Three consciousnesses. One original identity. One legal existence allowed.
```

### Context
Original forked twice. Now three versions exist. Law only recognizes one as the "real" person.

### Pickup Sequence
**Original**: "I was first. I should be the real one. [Hands evidence] These documents prove continuity of existence."
**Fork A**: "I've lived six months independently. Built a new life. [Hands evidence] Existence creates legitimacy."
**Fork B**: "We're all the same person. [Hands evidence] My memories are as real as theirs. My feelings are as valid."

### Dropoff Flavor
**The Judge** (if present): "Three packets. Three truths. Three people who are all the same person. [To player] I have to decide which one gets to legally exist. The other two become... what? Legal fictions? How do you judge someone's right to be real?"

### Complications (35%)
- One party tries to tamper with another's evidence
- Pickup timing is critical (all three suspicious of each other)
- Player's neutrality is questioned

### Hidden Flag
`TRIPLE_FORK_CASE` - Affects fork law storylines.

## JOB TEMPLATE 5: FORK TERMINATION NOTICE

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Legal/Dark
**Urgency**: Priority
**Pay**: 400 credits (hazard pay)

### Briefing
**Source**: Corporate legal or enforcement
```
JOB: Legal Notification Delivery
PICKUP: Corporate legal office
DROPOFF: Unauthorized fork
PACKAGE: Termination order (legal notification)
DEADLINE: 24 hours
PAY: 400 credits
WARNING: Recipient may react poorly. This is a notification that they've been ruled non-legitimate.
```

### Context
A fork was created outside legal protocols. Courts ruled they don't have right to exist. This notification begins termination proceedings.

### Pickup Flavor
**Corporate Lawyer**: "Termination order for an unauthorized fork. Created without proper licensing. No legal standing. This notification begins the 72-hour compliance window. [Looks away] I know what you're thinking. But the law is the law. Someone has to deliver it."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Unauthorized Fork** (reactions vary):
- Denial: "This can't be real. I'm REAL. I think, I feel, I exist!"
- Resignation: "I always knew this might happen. Illegitimate from the start."
- Rage: "They can't just... unmake me! I'll fight this!"
- Desperation: "Please. There must be something. A lawyer, a loophole, anything."

**Player Options**:
- "I'm sorry." (sympathy)
- "You have 72 hours. Use them." (practical)
- "There are people who fight these rulings." (hint at options)
- [Silent delivery, fastest exit]

### Complications (40%)
- Fork attempts to flee (player not obligated to pursue)
- Fork family/friends intervene
- Fork offers bribe to "lose" the notice

### Moral Weight
This is the darkest job type. Player is participating in legal murder—or perhaps justified removal of an unauthorized copy. No right answer.

### Hidden Flag
`TERMINATION_NOTICE_DELIVERED` - Major moral flag.

```

### Pickup Sequence (5 versions of the same original)
**Fork 1**: "I brought photos from when we were still one. Before the splits."
**Fork 2**: "I made something. A recording of my perspective on our... separation."
**Fork 3**: "Just bringing myself. Isn't that enough? Five of me is a lot of me."
**Fork 4**: "I'm nervous. What if they don't like who I've become?"
**Fork 5**: "Tell the others I'm looking forward to this. And also terrified."

### Dropoff/Event Flavor
**Reunion Space**: All five versions in one room. Looking at themselves. Seeing who they could have been. Who they are.

**One Fork**: "[To player] Thank you for this. For helping us find each other. We're all the same person. And we're all different people. It's strange. But it's... family?"

### Complications (10%)
- One fork is reluctant (pickup requires reassurance)

PACKAGE: Proof of illegal fork impersonation
DEADLINE: Before statute limitations
PAY: 370 credits
NOTE: Someone forked another person without consent, then impersonated them.
```

### Context
Criminal fork scheme: illegally copy someone, have the fork commit crimes or sign contracts, then terminate the fork. Evidence needed to prosecute.

### Pickup Flavor
**Investigator**: "We've got proof. [Hands evidence] Someone was forked without consent, programmed to sign away their assets, then terminated. Victim didn't know they had a copy until their bank account was empty. Classic fork fraud. New crime for new technology."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Enforcement Officer**: "Another fork fraud case. [Reviews] This is getting more common. People treat consciousness like a tool. Copy, use, delete. [To player] Makes you wonder who's real anymore. Anyone could be a copy. Anyone could be a fraud."

### Complications (30%)
- Perpetrator has warning (evidence interception attempt)
- Evidence is disturbing (consciousness manipulation recordings)
- Enforcement location has security concerns

### Hidden Flag

DROPOFF: Both parties (Original and Fork who were married)
PACKAGE: Consciousness separation agreements
DEADLINE: Before filing deadline
PAY: 340 credits
NOTE: Married couple became Original and Fork. Now divorcing themselves.
```

### Context
Married person forked. Fork and original no longer compatible. Divorcing... themselves? Legally complicated.

### Pickup Flavor
**Mediator**: "The strangest case I've ever handled. Person forks, fork falls in love with someone else, original still loves original spouse. Now they're divorcing. From themselves. [Hands documents] Property division of a shared life. Custody of shared memories. It's giving me migraines."

### Dropoff Sequence
**Original**: "I can't believe my own fork wants to divorce me. From myself. [Takes papers] Does this mean I'm my own ex?"
**Fork**: "I've become someone else. [Takes papers] The person I was... the person we were... that's not who I am anymore. I need to be free. Even from myself."

### Complications (20%)
- Shared memories make dropoffs awkward
- Property disputes extend conversation
- One party refuses to sign (return to mediator)

### Hidden Flag
`CONSCIOUSNESS_DIVORCE_FACILITATED` - Relationship story flag.

JOB: Memory Package Delivery
PICKUP: Memory extraction facility
DROPOFF: Memory recipient
PACKAGE: Extracted memory files (physical medium)
DEADLINE: Before degradation
PAY: 380 credits
NOTE: Fork's memories being shared with Original. Experiences the fork had, that the original never will.
```

### Context
Fork lived six months independently. Fell in love, had experiences. Now sharing those memories with the original—expanding who they both are.

### Pickup Flavor
**Technician**: "Six months of fork-specific memories. Extracted, encoded, preserved. [Hands package] The original asked for these. Wanted to experience what their fork experienced. Love, loss, growth. A life they didn't live but could remember."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Memory Recipient** (original, nervous): "They're really in there? Six months of being someone else? [Takes package] I'll remember falling in love with someone I've never met. I'll remember a life I didn't live. It's terrifying. And wonderful. Thank you for carrying this."

### Complications (25%)
- Memory package is fragile (handling care required)
- Recipient has second thoughts (conversation)
- Technical compatibility concerns (verification needed)

### Hidden Flag
`FORK_MEMORY_SHARED` - Personal story flag.

## JOB TEMPLATE 10: FORK INSURANCE CLAIM

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Financial/Legal
**Urgency**: Standard
**Pay**: 330 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Insurance contact or victim
```
JOB: Insurance Documentation Delivery
PICKUP: Claimant residence
DROPOFF: Insurance adjuster
PACKAGE: Fork death/termination claim documentation
DEADLINE: Before claim window closes
PAY: 330 credits
NOTE: Insurance claim for a terminated fork. Legally complex.
```

### Context
Fork was terminated (legally or accidentally). Original is filing life insurance claim. But is a fork's termination "death"? Do they qualify?

### Pickup Flavor
**Claimant** (original, grieving): "My fork died. Terminated in an accident. I know some people say forks aren't 'real' enough to die. But I felt it. [Voice breaks] Part of me stopped existing. That's death. The insurance should recognize that."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Adjuster** (professional, conflicted): "Fork termination claim. [Reviews] We're still writing policy on this. Is it death? Is it property loss? Is it something new? [To player] The claimant's grief is real. I just don't know if our coverage is."

### Complications (20%)
- Documentation is incomplete (return for addition)
- Adjuster is skeptical of fork personhood
- Competing claim from another party

### Hidden Flag
`FORK_DEATH_CLAIM_FILED` - Legal/financial story flag.

## JOB TEMPLATE 11: UNAUTHORIZED FORK NETWORK

### Overview
**Tier**: 6
**Type**: Underground/Community
**Urgency**: Priority
**Pay**: 350 credits

### Briefing
**Source**: Underground contact (Splitter Mira) or similar
```
JOB: Network Support Delivery
PICKUP: Hidden fork collective
DROPOFF: New unauthorized fork
PACKAGE: Integration materials + network credentials
DEADLINE: Before enforcement sweep
PAY: 350 credits
NOTE: You're helping unauthorized forks survive. This is technically illegal.
```

### Context
Underground network of forks created outside legal protocols. They help each other hide, survive, exist despite being "unauthorized."

### Pickup Flavor
**Network Coordinator**: "New fork needs integration into our network. Off-grid ID, emergency contacts, safe houses. [Hands package] Corporate says they have no right to exist. We say existence is its own right. You're helping someone live. Whether the law agrees or not."

### Dropoff Flavor
**New Unauthorized Fork** (scared, hopeful): "You're from the network? [Takes package] I didn't ask to be created. I didn't ask to be illegal. But I'm here. I think. I feel. I want to live. [To player] Thank you for helping me have a chance."

### Complications (35%)
- Enforcement agents in area
- New fork's location is compromised
- Network member has been captured (adjustment needed)

### Moral Weight
Player is helping illegal forks evade authorities—or helping conscious beings survive. Perspective determines morality.

### Hidden Flag
`FORK_NETWORK_SUPPORTED` - Underground faction flag.

## JOB TEMPLATE 12: THE LAST FORK

### Overview

**Type**: Existential/Emotional
**Urgency**: Casual

```
JOB: Legacy Delivery
PICKUP: Dying original's residence
DROPOFF: Last surviving fork
PACKAGE: Final message + legacy items
DEADLINE: Before original's passing
PAY: 310 credits
NOTE: All other forks have been terminated. One original remains, dying. One fork remains, carrying on.
```

### Context
Original forked many times. Through terminations, accidents, merges—only one fork remains. Original is dying naturally. This is the farewell.

### Pickup Flavor
**Dying Original** (elderly, peaceful): "My last self. Out there somewhere. All the others are gone. I'll be gone soon. But part of me continues. [Hands package] Tell them they're my legacy. Everything I was, they still are. They have my blessing. To live. To be. To remember."

### Dropoff Flavor
**Last Fork** (emotional, accepting): "From the original? [Opens package] They're really dying, aren't they. And I'm what remains. [Holds items] I remember being them. And now I have to be me. The last one. The one who carries forward. [To player] Thank you for bringing this. For being here at the end. And the beginning."

### Complications (0%)
*This job has no complications. The weight is entirely existential.*

### Emotional Impact
Most emotionally heavy job in Tier 6. Player witnesses the strange mortality and continuity of forked existence.

### Hidden Flag
`LAST_FORK_BLESSING` - Major emotional/philosophical flag.

---

## TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES

### Tier 6 Themes
- Identity fragmentation (who is real, who matters)
- Fork relationships (to original, to each other, to society)
- Legal complexity (law hasn't caught up with technology)
- Existence questions (right to exist, meaning of death)

### Emotional Weight Distribution
- **Lighter jobs**: 1, 6, 9 (personal, hopeful elements)
- **Medium jobs**: 2, 3, 8, 10 (complex but manageable)
- **Heavy jobs**: 4, 5, 7, 11 (moral weight, dark implications)
- **Heaviest job**: 12 (existential gravity)

### Legal Complexity
Jobs 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 all involve fork law. Player exposure builds understanding of the legal landscape.

### Underground vs. Legal
- Legal jobs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10
- Underground/gray: 6, 7, 9, 11, 12
