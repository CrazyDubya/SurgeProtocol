### ENCOUNTER P1: HIDDEN CACHE

**Tier Range**: 1-4
**Trigger**: Exploring off-main routes
**Frequency**: 3% base

**Setup**:
*Something catches your eye—a loose panel, a suspicious gap, the kind of place someone hides things. And forgot about.*

*Behind the panel: a small cache. Dusty. Untouched for months, maybe years. Someone's emergency stash, never retrieved.*

**Contents** (random):
- Credits (150-400)
- Medical supplies (3-5 stims)
- Low-tier chrome components
- Data chips (sellable or useful)
- Old weapon (functional, dated)

**Player Options**:
1. **Take everything**: Full loot, no consequences
2. **Take some**: Partial loot, less guilt
3. **Leave marker**: Come back later
4. **Report to Chen**: Small reputation boost, finder's fee

**Follow-up** (5% chance):
Original owner (or their heir) eventually seeks the cache. Could lead to grateful meeting or tense confrontation depending on player's choice.
