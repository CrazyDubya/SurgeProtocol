## MORAL CHOICES

### ENCOUNTER U1: THE BYSTANDER

**Tier Range**: All
**Trigger**: Transit through any area
**Frequency**: 4%

**Setup**:
*Someone's being harassed. Not attacked—yet—but the situation is escalating. Others are watching. No one is acting.*

**Scene**:
- Corporate employee bullying service worker
- Gang members intimidating shop owner
- Checkpoint guard humiliating traveler
- Drunk harassing stranger

**Victim's Look**:
*They see you see them. Eyes that don't ask for help—they've learned not to—but hope anyway.*

**Options**:
1. **Intervene**: Stop the harassment. Consequences vary.
2. **Witness**: Watch without acting. See what happens.
3. **Document**: Record for later use. Proof of something.
4. **Distract**: Create diversion without direct confrontation.
5. **Walk away**: Not your problem. Everyone else is walking away too.

**Outcomes**:
- Intervene: May earn ally, may earn enemy, definitely noticed
- Witness: See resolution (good or bad), remember it
- Document: Evidence for later—leverage or justice
- Distract: Situation defuses, no credit or blame

### ENCOUNTER U2: THE OFFER

**Tier Range**: 2-5
**Trigger**: After completing job for new contact
**Frequency**: 5%

**Setup**:
*The job is done. Payment confirmed. Then they lean in. There's something else.*

**Offer Types**:
- "Want to make real money? One job. Very illegal. Very lucrative."
- "I can connect you with people. Important people. If you're willing to do important things."
- "That package you just delivered? There's a bonus for certain... additional services."
- "You seem trustworthy. I need someone trustworthy. For something I can't explain yet."

**No Details Given**: The offer is vague. Accepting means stepping into the unknown.

**Options**:
1. **Accept**: Enter new storyline, unknown consequences
2. **Decline**: Safe, but door closes
3. **Ask questions**: They may answer, may withdraw offer
4. **Stall**: "Let me think about it" (offer may expire)
5. **Report**: Tell someone about the approach

**Outcome**:
Accepting leads to side content—could be profitable, dangerous, both, neither. Declining is also a choice with consequences.
