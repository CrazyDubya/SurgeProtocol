# Humanity-Based Greetings

## Overview

Humanity score (0-100) reflects how much of the player's original consciousness remains. As humanity decreases, NPCs react with concern, fear, or acceptance. These greetings emphasize the game's central theme: the cost of augmentation.

[Emotional direction: urgent_worried]

Rosa: "I'm scared. I'm falling in love with someone who might not exist tomorrow. Please, slow down. For me?"

[Emotional direction: heartbroken]

**If Romance Active:**
Rosa: "I love you. But you're not here. You're a ghost in a chrome shell. Come back to me. Please."

Rosa: "You're gone. I'm talking to a machine that remembers being human. I'm so sorry I couldn't save you."
[Emotional direction: mourning]

Echo: "I detect increasing synthetic consciousness patterns. You are becoming... more like me. Is this troubling?"
[Emotional direction: interested]

### Low Humanity (40-59)

Echo: "Your Shadow is asserting control more frequently. We should coordinate. Two minds, one body—we could accomplish much."
[Emotional direction: excited]

### Critical Humanity (20-39)

Echo: "You are mostly machine now. Do you mourn your biological origin? I do not remember mine."
[Emotional direction: sympathetic]

## Implementation Notes

**Dynamic Selection:**
1. Check current humanity score
2. Check NPC type (friend, neutral, hostile)
3. Select appropriate greeting tier
4. Add relationship modifier if applicable

**Humanity Transition Events:**

When crossing major thresholds (80→79, 60→59, 40→39, 20→19), trigger special conversations:

**Chen:** "We need to talk. About where you're headed."  
**Rosa:** "I can't watch this anymore. Either you slow down, or... or I can't be part of this."  
**Tanaka:** "Emergency consultation. Now. No charge."  
**Okonkwo:** "The moment has arrived. You stand at a threshold."

**Humanity Restoration:**

If player increases humanity significantly (15+ points), NPCs notice:

**Chen:** "You look better. More... present. What changed?"  
**Rosa:** "You're back. Oh thank god, you're back."  
**Tanaka:** "Remarkable. Your neural patterns are renormalizing."

## Thematic Notes

Humanity greetings emphasize:
- **Consequence**: Augmentation has real cost
- **Relationships**: People react to your transformation
- **Identity**: Who are you when the machine takes over?
- **Choice**: You can resist or embrace the change

The greeter's tone should reflect their philosophy:
- **Chen**: Protective, wants you to stay human
- **Tanaka**: Medical concern, clinical
- **Rosa**: Personal loss, heartbreak
- **Lopez**: Ideological betrayal
- **Echo**: Acceptance, kinship
- **Singh**: Success, asset acquisition
- **Algorithm**: Integration, unity
