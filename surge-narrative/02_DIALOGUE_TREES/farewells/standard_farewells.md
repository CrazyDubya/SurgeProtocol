## Implementation Notes

**Farewell Selection Logic:**
1. Check conversation outcome (quest given, information shared, argument, etc.)
2. Check relationship tier
3. Check time of day
4. Check special conditions (humanity, quest flags, urgency)
5. Select appropriate farewell
6. Avoid repeating same farewell consecutively

**Variety:** Each NPC should have 5-10 different farewells to prevent repetition

**Consistency:** Farewell should match conversation tone. Don't end serious conversation with joke.

**Callbacks:** Occasionally reference earlier conversation topics in farewell
