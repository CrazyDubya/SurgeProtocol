**Teaching Philosophy**:
"Chrome is not separate from you—it is you, extended. Your arm, your leg, your eye. When you treat it as tool, you limit both. When you treat it as self, you become something more."

**Training**:
"Again. [Watches attempt] Your Algorithm suggests movement. You resist suggestion. Stop resisting. Listen. Let it become instinct."

### Dialogue

**Greeting**:
"Welcome. [Warm smile] This is a safe space. Whatever you're experiencing—with your Algorithm, with your work, with yourself—we can work through it together."

**On Integration**:
"The Algorithm becomes part of you. That's significant. Some people adapt quickly; others struggle. Both responses are normal. What matters is processing the experience healthily."

**On Courier Work**:
"Your job exposes you to stress most people never face. Running, danger, moral complexity. That accumulates. Regular processing isn't weakness—it's maintenance. Like charging your chrome."

**Therapy Moment**:
"You mentioned feeling 'not yourself' since integration. [Listening] That's common. The question is: who do you want to become now? The Algorithm doesn't answer that. You do."

"My cousin Solomon works with higher-tier concerns—spiritual dimensions of Algorithm consciousness. If you're ready for that, I can introduce you. But that's different work."

"Before we discuss specifics, I need to know: is this problem your fault, someone else's fault, or circumstance? [Listening] Different categories, different approaches."
