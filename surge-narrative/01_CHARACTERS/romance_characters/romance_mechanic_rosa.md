## Background
- **Origin Story**: Third-generation Hollows resident. Grandmother immigrated, parents ran an auto shop until corpo squeeze shut them down. Rosa learned mechanics from her father, augment repair from necessity. Took the station job to keep her community mobile.

## Sample Dialogue Sequence: "The Question of Chrome"

**Context**: Tier 4, player has just installed 5th augment, Rosa notices

**NODE 1** (NPC_LINE):
Rosa: [looking at your new augment] "Reflex booster? That's what, number five now?" [not judging, just observing]

**NODE 2** (PLAYER_RESPONSE_HUB):

- **Option A**: "I need every edge I can get." [PRAGMATIC]
  - → NODE 3 (Rosa understanding but sad)

- **Option B**: "You think it's too much?" [DEFENSIVE]
  - → NODE 4 (Rosa reassuring)

- **Option C**: "Does it bother you?" [VULNERABLE]
  - Condition: Relationship > 50
  - → NODE 5 (Rosa honest about fears)

- **Option D**: "It's just tools. Means to an end." [DISMISSIVE]
  - → NODE 6 (Rosa challenges this)

**NODE 3** (NPC_LINE):
Rosa: "I get it. This city chews up anyone who can't keep pace." [pause] "Just remember there's a line. Between using tools and becoming one."

**NODE 4** (NPC_LINE):
Rosa: [gentle] "Hey, I'm not judging. Your body, your choice. I just... I care about you. Want to make sure you're choosing, not being chosen for."

**NODE 5** (Rosa's Honest Fear):
Rosa: [exhales] "Honestly? Yeah, it bothers me. Not the chrome itself, but..." [struggles for words] "I dated someone who went heavy aug. Every upgrade, a little less of him came back. Eventually I was sleeping next to an optimized stranger."

[looks at you directly]

"I don't want that to be us. So yeah, it scares me. But I trust you to know your limits."

**PLAYER SUB-HUB**:
- "I'm not him. I know when to stop." → Rosa: "I hope so." [Relationship +5]
- "Maybe you should trust me more." → Rosa: "Trust goes both ways." [Relationship -5]
- "I'll be careful. I promise." → Rosa: "That's all I ask." [Relationship +10]

**NODE 6** (Rosa Challenges):
Rosa: "Is it, though? Tools don't rewrite your neural architecture. Tools don't whisper in your ear at 3 AM telling you to optimize." [frustrated] "The Algorithm wants you to think it's just tools. Makes it easier to swallow."

**Relationship**: -3 (player was dismissive)

## Character Arc Outcomes

### Romance Success Path
- **Requirements**: Humanity > 60 at Tier 9, Relationship > 85, didn't betray community
- **Result**: Rosa joins player in chosen path (Rogue or Third Path)
- **Epilogue**: Building life together, Rosa opens community tech center

### Romance Failure Path
- **Triggers**: Humanity < 60, Ascension chosen, Miguel died and player was responsible
- **Result**: Heartbreak scene, Rosa cuts contact
- **Epilogue**: Rosa grieves, eventually heals, continues community work

### Friendship Path
- **Requirements**: Never pursued romance, maintained relationship
- **Result**: Rosa remains close friend and ally
- **Epilogue**: Continues supporting player from The Hollows

### Estrangement Path
- **Triggers**: Betrayed community, killed Miguel, heavy chrome + low humanity
- **Result**: Rosa becomes cold, professional only
- **Epilogue**: Rosa remembers you as a cautionary tale

## Thematic Function

Rosa represents:
1. **Humanity Anchor**: Proves low-chrome competence is viable
2. **Community Values**: Shows collective care vs. individual optimization
3. **Romantic Stakes**: Love requires staying human enough to connect
4. **Tragic Mirror**: Her ex's fate foreshadows player's potential future
5. **Hope**: Demonstrates resistance is possible, meaningful life without Ascension exists

Her romance arc asks: **Can you love someone while losing yourself? Can you be loved by a person when you're becoming a system?**
