## NPC 1: "OLD SALT" VIKTOR PETROV

**Role**: Retired Dockmaster
**Location**: Harbor overlook bench
**Age**: 74
**Appearance**: White beard, captain's coat (faded), prosthetic left eye (old model, visible seam)

**Background**: 50 years on the docks. Knows every ship, every route, every secret. Now watches the harbor and shares stories.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Forty years I ran these docks. Now I just watch. The ships change. The cargo changes. The corruption stays the same."
- "You want to know about Harbor routes? Buy me a drink. I know shortcuts the maps forgot."
- "See that ship? The Esperanza? Good captain. Does good work. The kind they don't put in official manifests."

**Utility**: Historical information, route tips, Captain Santos introduction

## NPC 2: MARINA COSTA

**Role**: Union Steward (Dock Chapter)
**Location**: Dock workers' hall
**Age**: 45
**Appearance**: Work coveralls, muscled arms, union badge worn prominently, clipboard always in hand

**Background**: Third-generation dock worker. Fights for better conditions. Connected to Sister Grace and Lopez networks.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "You're a courier? Independent contractor, right? No protection, no benefits, no backup. That's not freedom—that's vulnerability they call opportunity."
- "The corporations own the cargo. The unions protect the workers. Everyone else? Everyone else gets squeezed in between."
- "If you ever need help—real help—the union has resources. We look out for workers. Even independent ones."

**Utility**: Union connection, worker solidarity network, emergency support

## NPC 3: CHEN XI (No Relation)

**Role**: Dock Crane Operator
**Location**: Crane 7, harbor industrial zone
**Age**: 38
**Appearance**: Hardhat, reinforced spine chrome (occupational necessity), tired eyes but steady hands

**Background**: Works 12-hour shifts moving containers. Sees everything from above. Notices patterns others miss.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "From up there, you see things. Which containers get special handling. Which ships dock at unusual hours. I don't talk about it usually. But you seem trustworthy."
- "Courier work looks free from up here. Running your own routes. Making your own choices. Meanwhile I move what they tell me, when they tell me. But steady pay is worth something."
- "There's a container that comes through monthly. Never manifested. Never inspected. Whatever's inside... someone important wants it invisible."

**Utility**: Surveillance information, mysterious cargo hooks, dock layout knowledge

## NPC 4: "FISH" ANTONIO REYES

**Role**: Fishing Boat Captain
**Location**: Harbor pier 12, small vessel "María"
**Age**: 52
**Appearance**: Weathered hands, fish-scale stains on everything, honest face, Catholic medallion

**Background**: One of the last independent fishermen. Supplements income with "unofficial transport." Knows the water routes.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "The corporations bought most fishing rights. I'm one of the stubborn ones. This boat was my father's. I'll sink before I sell."
- "Sometimes I carry passengers. People who need to go places without official channels. Legal? Depends who's asking. Moral? I sleep fine."
- "You need water transport, I'm cheaper than Santos. Less professional too—but for small packages, I'm your man."

**Utility**: Alternative smuggling contact, ocean routes, honest gray work

## NPC 5: DR. NADIA OKOYE

**Role**: Harbor Clinic Doctor
**Location**: Harbor Industrial Medical Center
**Age**: 41
**Appearance**: Medical scrubs, efficient movements, exhaustion she's learned to hide, minimal chrome (diagnostic only)

**Background**: Runs the industrial accident clinic. Sees broken bodies daily. Has become political about worker safety.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Another broken arm? Crushing injury? Let me guess—safety protocols weren't followed because they slow productivity."
- "I patch them up. They go back to work. They get hurt again. I patch them up again. It's a cycle. The corporations budget for injuries—they've calculated it's cheaper than safety."
- "You couriers are healthier than dock workers, at least. Running keeps the body moving. Just don't let anyone break you."

**Utility**: Medical services, injury treatment, worker injury statistics, motivation for union support

---

## NPC 6: TOMMY "WHEELS" NAKAMURA

**Role**: Mechanic (Vehicle & Chrome)
**Location**: Harbor garage
**Age**: 29
**Appearance**: Grease-covered everything, mechanical arm (self-installed), creative hair arrangement

**Background**: Fixes anything mechanical—vehicles, chrome, equipment. Works cheap, works fast, doesn't ask questions.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Rosa's got the Hollows covered. I handle Harbor. Different style—she's precision, I'm improvisation. Both get the job done."
- "Your chrome acting up? Let me look. [Examines] Corporate installation. Good hardware, unnecessary restrictions. I can remove the limiters if you want. Voids warranty. Improves function."
- "I built my arm myself. Third attempt. First two didn't work so well. [Flexes mechanical fingers] Learning curve was steep. But I know every wire in this thing."

**Utility**: Chrome modifications, vehicle repairs, equipment upgrades, Rosa alternative

## NPC 7: MOTHER LI

**Role**: Harbor Temple Keeper
**Location**: Small shrine near harbor entrance
**Age**: 68
**Appearance**: Traditional robes modified with waterproof material, calm presence, incense always burning

**Background**: Maintains an ancient shrine that predates the industrial harbor. Offers blessings, advice, and sanctuary.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "The harbor was here before the corporations. This shrine was here before the harbor. Some things persist. Find what persists in you."
- "Workers come for blessings before dangerous shifts. Couriers come before dangerous runs. I pray for all of them. The prayers don't guarantee safety. But they help."
- "If you ever need a place to rest—truly rest—my temple is sanctuary. No one disturbs those who seek peace here. Not even the corporations."

**Utility**: Sanctuary location, spiritual perspective, rest point

## NPC 8: DETECTIVE LIANG (HARBOR BEAT)

**Role**: Harbor District Police Officer
**Location**: Harbor district streets
**Age**: 36
**Appearance**: Worn uniform, realistic expectations, slight limp (old injury), cynical but not corrupt

**Background**: Honest cop in a compromised system. Does what he can. Looks the other way on small stuff. Pursues real crimes.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "I know what happens on these docks. The stuff I can prove, I pursue. The stuff I can't... I pick my battles. No point dying over cargo that's going to move anyway."
- "You're a courier? Stay out of my investigations and I'll stay out of yours. Fair deal. We're both just trying to do our jobs."
- "If you see something bad—I mean really bad, not just gray market cargo—I want to know. Some crimes I can actually do something about. The ones that hurt people."

**Utility**: Law enforcement contact (non-hostile), serious crime reporting, gray zone tolerance
