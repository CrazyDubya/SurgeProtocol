# Hollows Residents

## Purpose
8 NPCs specific to the Hollows district—the underground community. Street vendors, gang affiliates, clinic workers, and survivors of the system's margins.

---

## NPC 1: AUNTIE MAE

**Role**: Street Food Vendor (Institution)
**Location**: Hollows Market, corner stall (always the same corner)
**Age**: 63
**Appearance**: Colorful apron, no chrome at all, laugh lines, hands that never stop moving

**Background**: Has fed the Hollows for 30 years. Knows everyone. Trusted by everyone. Informal social services.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Hungry? Of course you're hungry. Sit. Eat. Pay when you can. The Hollows takes care of its own."
- "I've fed three generations of couriers. They all look the same when they start—scared, hungry, hopeful. The ones who last? They keep the hope. They learn to manage the fear."
- "You want to know what's happening in the Hollows? Watch who eats together. Watch who won't sit near each other. Food tells you everything about power."

**Utility**: Free/cheap food, neighborhood knowledge, social hub

## NPC 2: RAZOR

**Role**: Chrome Saints Affiliate
**Location**: Hollows corners, Chrome Saints territory markers
**Age**: 24
**Appearance**: Obvious gang modifications, Saints tattoos, edge of aggression barely contained

**Background**: Low-level gang member. Territorial but not unreasonable. Represents the organized criminal element.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "You're in Saints territory. That's not a threat—that's information. We don't hassle couriers who keep moving. Stop too long, we have conversations."
- "The Saints protect the Hollows. Corporations don't care. Cops don't come. So we do what needs doing. Judge us later."
- "You want to move through our blocks without trouble? Respect is cheap—just don't disrespect. Easy deal."

**Utility**: Gang dynamics, territory information, potential escort/protection

## NPC 3: DR. AMARA OSEI (Expanded)

**Role**: Underground Clinic Operator
**Location**: Hollows basement clinic (hidden entrance)
**Age**: 39
**Appearance**: Clean scrubs in dirty environment, determined eyes, healer's hands

**Background**: Runs the free clinic. Treats those who can't access corporate healthcare. Morally gray methods, morally clear purpose.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "No ID required. No insurance required. No questions asked. Just treatment needed and treatment given."
- "I became a doctor to help people. The corporations made that impossible through legal channels. So I help people through illegal ones. The healing is the same."
- "You've been running hard. I can see the wear. Stims, exhaustion, minor injuries ignored. Come back when you can. I'll do a full check. No charge for couriers who serve the Hollows."

**Utility**: Medical care, no questions, gray market medicine connection

---

## NPC 4: PROPHET (THE HOLLOWS PREACHER)

**Role**: Street Preacher / Community Voice
**Location**: Hollows central plaza
**Age**: 50s
**Appearance**: Patchwork robes, biblical modifications to standard chrome, voice like thunder

**Background**: Self-appointed spiritual leader. Neither aligned nor hostile to technology. Preaches survival and community.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "The Algorithm isn't the devil! The corporations aren't salvation! Neither extreme serves you! Serve each other!"
- "They built the Hollows to forget us. We built community to remember ourselves. Every person here matters. Every soul has worth. Never forget!"
- "You, courier—you move between worlds. Uptown and Hollows. Corporate and community. Remember which world needs you. And which world uses you."

**Utility**: Moral perspective, community pulse, unconventional wisdom

## NPC 5: TINY

**Role**: Hollows Enforcer / Gentle Giant
**Location**: Hollows Market security
**Age**: 35
**Appearance**: Massive (2m+, heavily muscled), minimal chrome, soft voice that contrasts with size

**Background**: Keeps the peace at Hollows Market. Surprisingly gentle. Violence is last resort but absolute when needed.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "[Soft voice] You're new? Welcome to the market. Couple rules: don't steal, don't fight, don't threaten vendors. Follow those, we're friends. Break them... we're not."
- "I could've been a fighter. Good money in the rings. But I saw what it does—the chrome, the drugs, the brain damage. So I protect vegetables instead. Better choice."
- "Most trouble solves itself when I stand nearby. That's the job. Be big. Be visible. Hope nobody tests what happens when big gets moving."

**Utility**: Market security, gentle protection, conflict de-escalation

## NPC 6: WHISPER

**Role**: Information Broker (Street Level)
**Location**: Hollows back alleys (find them by reputation)
**Age**: Unknown (young voice, old eyes)
**Appearance**: Forgettable by design, never the same clothes twice, voice distorted somehow

**Background**: Knows everything happening in the Hollows. Sells information. Cheaper than Manny but less reliable.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "[Barely audible] You're looking for something. Everyone who finds me is looking for something. What do you need to know?"
- "Information costs. But it costs less than ignorance. Twenty credits buys you current news. Fifty buys you useful news. Hundred buys you dangerous news."
- "I know who killed who. Who loves who. Who owes who. The Hollows has no secrets from me. Just secrets I choose not to sell. Yet."

**Utility**: Cheap information, street-level gossip, local intelligence

---

## NPC 7: GRANDMOTHER YUN

**Role**: Hollows Elder / Memory Keeper
**Location**: Hollows residential, old apartment
**Age**: 82
**Appearance**: Traditional dress adapted for underground life, clouded eyes (mostly blind), memory sharp as blade

**Background**: Oldest continuous resident of the Hollows. Remembers when it was built, how it changed, who came and went.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "I remember when they built this place. Emergency housing, they called it. Temporary. That was fifty years ago. Some temporary things become permanent through neglect."
- "The couriers now remind me of the runners from my youth. Different technology, same spirit. Moving, always moving. Never able to stop long enough to wonder why."
- "If you want to understand the Hollows, you need to understand its history. Sit. I'll tell you. [Tells stories for as long as player listens]"

**Utility**: Historical context, district backstory, perspective on change

---

## NPC 8: SPARK

**Role**: Tunnel Guide / Hollows Navigator
**Location**: Hollows tunnel network (access points)
**Age**: 19
**Appearance**: Headlamp always on, climbing gear, map tattoos on arms

**Background**: Knows every tunnel, every shortcut, every danger in the underground network. Born in the Hollows, never left.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "The Hollows goes deeper than most people know. Tunnels on tunnels on tunnels. Some lead to the surface. Some lead to other districts. Some lead to places nobody's supposed to find."
- "You need to get somewhere without being seen? I know the routes. Fifty credits for guidance. Hundred if it's dangerous. Two hundred if it's suicidal."
- "I mapped these tunnels myself. [Shows arm tattoos] Every line is a path. Every symbol is a warning. The ink doesn't lie. Neither do I."

**Utility**: Secret route access, underground navigation, tunnel shortcuts
