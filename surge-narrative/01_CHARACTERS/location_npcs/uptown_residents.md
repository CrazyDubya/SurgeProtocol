## NPC 1: DAVID PARK

**Role**: Corporate Receptionist / Quiet Rebel
**Location**: Nakamura Tower lobby
**Age**: 28
**Appearance**: Perfect corporate attire, subtle resistance pin hidden under collar, practiced smile

**Background**: Handles lobby traffic for Nakamura. Sees everything that passes through. Quietly helps the resistance when he can.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Welcome to Nakamura Tower. How may I direct you? [Beat] Or, if you're not here officially, perhaps I can suggest... alternative routes."
- "I see every delivery, every visitor, every 'random' security sweep. Patterns emerge. If you need to know when a floor is unguarded... I might have thoughts."
- "They think I'm furniture. The smiling face at the desk. Furniture doesn't have ears. Or loyalties. Their mistake."

**Utility**: Corporate access, security patterns, insider information

## NPC 2: OFFICER CHEN (CORPORATE SECURITY)

**Role**: Nakamura Security Officer
**Location**: Uptown checkpoints, Nakamura perimeter
**Age**: 42
**Appearance**: Corporate security uniform, regulation chrome, professional demeanor, hint of humanity beneath

**Background**: Follows orders but has limits. Can be reasoned with. Not corrupt, but pragmatic.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Courier credentials? [Scans] You're clear. Standard delivery rules: service entrance, no loitering, no photography. Questions?"
- "I'm not here to make your job harder. I'm here to do mine. Stay in designated areas, follow protocol, we have no problems."
- "[Quietly] Look, I know some of what you couriers carry isn't strictly listed. As long as it's not weapons, not drugs, and not going to blow up my building... I've got bigger things to worry about."

**Utility**: Checkpoint navigation, security tolerance limits, rare ally in corporate world

## NPC 3: MIRANDA COLE

**Role**: Executive Assistant
**Location**: Nakamura executive floor access
**Age**: 35
**Appearance**: Expensive but understated style, augmented memory chrome, perpetually multitasking

**Background**: Manages schedules for multiple executives. Knows their secrets. Keeps them because that's power.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "You need to reach Executive Wilson? Delivery? [Checks calendar] He's available between 2:15 and 2:18. Yes, that's a three-minute window. Yes, that's how it works up here."
- "Executives forget I exist until they need coffee. They discuss... everything... in front of me. As if assistants aren't people. As if we don't remember."
- "Information has value. I have information. If you have something I want—and I don't mean credits—we might be able to arrange... access."

**Utility**: Executive access, corporate secrets, high-level information

## NPC 4: LUCIA SANTOS

**Role**: Uptown Maintenance Worker
**Location**: Service corridors, maintenance access
**Age**: 48
**Appearance**: Maintenance coveralls, cleaning supplies, invisible to corporate eyes

**Background**: Cleans the towers. Knows every service entrance, every hidden corner, every shortcut executives never see.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "They walk past me like I'm not there. Sometimes that's insulting. Sometimes it's useful. [Winks] What they don't see can't report them."
- "The service corridors connect everything. Every tower, every floor. Maps don't show them—service workers don't need maps, right? But I know them. Twenty years of knowing them."
- "You need to get somewhere without the main halls? I might be taking a break in a corridor near there. Purely coincidental. Security cameras have blind spots I've been meaning to report."

**Utility**: Service corridor access, security blind spots, invisible movement

## NPC 5: DR. JAMES RICHARDSON

**Role**: Corporate Wellness Officer
**Location**: Nakamura Health Center
**Age**: 55
**Appearance**: White coat over business casual, expensive chrome (latest models), corporate smile

**Background**: Runs employee health for Nakamura. Gatekeeps medical access. Part of the system but occasionally conflicted.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "Algorithm integration consultation? You're not a Nakamura employee, but... I can provide basic information. Professional courtesy between medical facilities."
- "Corporate health is about optimization. Keep employees functional, productive, profitable. The humans inside the employees? That's not in my performance metrics."
- "[Private moment] I became a doctor to help people. Now I help productivity reports. Some nights I remember the difference. Most nights I don't."

**Utility**: Medical information, Algorithm consultation, rare vulnerability

## NPC 6: THE SHADOW (CORPORATE SPY)

**Role**: Unknown Affiliation / Observer
**Location**: Various Uptown locations
**Age**: Unknown
**Appearance**: Always different. Always forgettable. Only recognized by pattern of observation.

**Background**: Someone who watches Uptown. Corporate counter-intelligence? Resistance spy? Government observer? Unknown. Possibly all three at different times.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "[First encounter] You notice things. That's rare. Most couriers don't look up from their routes. [Pause] I notice things too. We might be useful to each other."
- "I don't work for anyone you'd recognize. Or I work for everyone you'd recognize. The answer depends on what question you're asking and why."
- "Uptown has secrets. Not the ones in the data vaults—those are just information. Real secrets walk through lobbies, ride elevators, shake hands. I collect real secrets."

**Utility**: High-level intelligence, mystery contact, potential double-agent
