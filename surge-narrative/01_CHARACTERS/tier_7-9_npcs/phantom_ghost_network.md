## Personality

### Core Traits
- **Professional**: Every interaction is business, no personal connection
- **Pragmatic**: Does what works, nothing more
- **Detached**: Emotionally neutral, doesn't judge client choices
- **Efficient**: Minimal words, maximum effect
- **Trustworthy** (paradox): Anonymous, but reputation is spotless

### Motivations

- **Client confidentiality**: Sacred—never reveals sources or destinations
- **Freedom**: Everyone should have option to leave the system

## Background

### Origin Story
No one knows Phantom's real name or origin. Ghost Network tradition: when you join, you shed identity. Phantom has been with the Network for at least 10 years. Rumored to be:
- Former corpo security who went rogue
- Ex-government agent who defected
- Criminal who found redemption
- Someone who simply chose to disappear

Phantom doesn't confirm or deny. "Who I was doesn't matter. What I do now does."

Over a decade, Phantom has extracted hundreds of people—couriers, corpo workers, augment-addicts fleeing debt, political dissidents, abuse survivors. Success rate: 100%. No client has ever been recaptured. Ghost Network's reputation rests largely on Phantom's competence.

### Relationship to Player
Views player as potential client or potential asset. If player reaches Tier 8, they're valuable enough to be offered extraction. If player helps Ghost Network, they might be recruited. Phantom is evaluating: Does player want out? Or do they want in?

---

## Character Arc

### Pre-Tier 8: Shadow Observation
Ghost Network has been watching player since Tier 5. Player's skills, choices, and independence mark them as either:
- **Extraction candidate** (wants to escape system)
- **Recruitment prospect** (wants to help others escape)

Phantom reviews player's file, decides which pitch to make.

---

### Tier 8: "Ghost Protocol" - The Offer

**Context**: Three factions recruit simultaneously. Phantom represents Ghost Network/Rogue path.

**The Meeting**: Abandoned building, rooftop, night. Phantom appears from shadows.

**PHANTOM** (quiet, direct):
"I'm called Phantom. Ghost Network. You don't know me. That's intentional. But I know you. Tier 8 courier. Independent. Skilled. And, I think, tired of the system. Am I wrong?"

**The Pitch**:

"Ghost Network helps people disappear. Cleanly. Permanently. Corpo debt? Gone. Augment repo threats? Irrelevant. Algorithm tracking? Severed. Rating system? Meaningless. We extract you, give you new identity, move you off-grid. You start over. No past. No corpo ownership. Free.

You're Tier 8. High value. Corps will want to own you soon. Yamada's probably offering you Ascension—death dressed as transcendence. Lopez is offering you Union—community, but you're still in the system. Both have merit. But neither is freedom.

We offer the third option: leave entirely. The city. The network. The game. Just... gone. We've done this for hundreds. Zero failures. Zero recaptures.

I'm here to tell you: if you want out, we can make it happen. No cost beyond what you can afford. No strings. No loyalty demanded. Just extraction and new life.

Think about it. When you're ready—if you're ready—contact me. You have the encryption key now."

**Player Options**:

**Option A - Express Interest**:
- "I might want that. Tell me more."
- Phantom provides details: extraction process, safe house locations, off-grid communities
- **Story Flag**: `PHANTOM_RELATIONSHIP +15`, `GHOST_RECRUITED = true`

**Option B - Express Skepticism**:
- "How do I know you're legit? Could be a trap."
- Phantom accepts: "Smart. Trust is earned. Research us. Ask around. We'll be here when you're certain."
- **Story Flag**: `PHANTOM_RELATIONSHIP +5`, `GHOST_RECRUITED = false`

**Option C - Reject**:
- "I'm not running. I'll handle the system myself."
- Phantom nods: "Respectable. But the offer stands. Forever. If you change your mind—ten years from now, even—Ghost Network remembers its offers."
- **Story Flag**: `PHANTOM_RELATIONSHIP 0`, `GHOST_RECRUITED = false`

**Option D - Ask to Help Network**:
- "I don't want extraction. But I could help. Recruit? Guide others?"
- Phantom considers: "Unusual. But useful. If you prove trustworthy, we'll talk again."
- **Story Flag**: `PHANTOM_RELATIONSHIP +20`, `GHOST_RECRUITED = ally`, opens recruitment path

---

### Between Tier 8-9: Optional Missions

**If Player Interested in Extraction**:
- Phantom sends occasional messages
- Tests player's commitment with small tasks (deliver supply package to safe house, scout extraction route)
- Builds trust for Tier 9 extraction offer

**If Player Offered to Help**:
- Phantom assigns missions: extract Rogues, guide fugitives, provide safe house access
- Player becomes informal Ghost Network associate
- **Side Quest Available**: "Ghost Network Operations" (extract 2-3 NPCs)

---

### Tier 9: The Gathering - Final Offer

**If Player Interested or Undecided**:

**PHANTOM** (at The Gathering, calm and certain):
"Tier 9. Last rank. Now you choose your ending. I'll tell you what the others won't:

Ascension is death. You upload, a copy wakes up thinking it's you. But you—the person here now—dies on that table. Tanaka knows it. Yamada won't admit it.

Third Path is risk. Solomon's ritual might work. Might not. You could lose yourself trying to balance Algorithm and humanity. Unprecedented. Experimental.

Rogue is simple: You leave. We extract you. Chrome removed. New life. Mortal, yes. Limited, yes. But free. Truly free. And alive. The meat dies eventually—but you live until then as yourself.

I've extracted hundreds. They're happy. Not optimized. Not eternal. Just... happy. Human-scale happiness. That's worth something.

If you choose Rogue, I'll handle everything. Chrome extraction with Dr. Tanaka. Transport to safe house. New identity. New life. You say the word, it happens."

**If Player Already Decided Against Rogue**:

**PHANTOM** (brief, accepting):
"You've made your choice. I respect that. But remember: Ghost Network never closes doors. Five years from now, you regret your upload or your ritual—we can't undo those. But if you ever need to disappear, we're here. Always."

---

### Post-Choice: Epilogue Reactions

**If Player Chose Rogue**:
- Phantom personally oversees extraction
- Coordinates with Tanaka for chrome removal
- Arranges transport, safe house, new identity
- Final words: "You're free now. Stay that way. And if you want to help others find freedom—you know how to reach us."
- **Player may encounter Phantom in off-grid community epilogue**

**If Player Chose Ascension**:
- Phantom observes upload from distance
- Quietly marks player as "lost—Ascended"
- No judgment, just... sadness
- Moves on to next extraction

**If Player Chose Third Path**:
- Phantom is intrigued: "You did something we can't. You're still in the system but not owned by it. Interesting. Maybe there's more than just escape."
- Ghost Network studies player's Third Path (potential new option for clients?)

## Dialogue Style

### Speech Patterns
- **Minimal**: Uses fewest words necessary
- **Direct**: No small talk, no fluff
- **Quiet**: Speaks softly (you lean in to listen)
- **Precise**: Every word chosen carefully
- **Questions as statements**: "You want out, yes?" (already knows)

### Example Dialogue

**Initial Recruitment**:
"Ghost Network. We extract people. You're Tier 8. Valuable. Corps will want to own you. We offer escape. Interested?"

**Explaining Process**:
"Chrome extraction. Painful but necessary. New identity. New face if needed. Transport to off-grid community. Total disappearance. No traces. We've done this hundreds of times. Zero failures."

**Handling Skepticism**:
"Doubt is smart. Research us. Ask your fixer—Delilah knows us. Ask Union—Lopez works with us. We're real. We're good at this. But verify yourself."

**If Player Helps Network**:
"Good work. Client extracted successfully. You're reliable. We value that. More work available if you want it."

**At The Gathering (Final Pitch)**:
"Three paths. Only one keeps you alive AND free. Not eternal. Not optimized. Just alive. Human. Free. That's Rogue. That's what we offer. Last chance to say yes."

**After Player Goes Rogue**:
"Welcome to the other side. You're off the grid now. No tracking. No corpo debt. No Algorithm. Just you. Use it well. And if you ever want to help others escape—we're here."

**If Player Chooses Different Path**:
"Your choice. I respect it. But if you ever need out—five years, ten years, whenever—Ghost Network remembers. We'll be here."

## Hidden Depth: The 100% Success Rate

Phantom's 100% extraction success rate is Ghost Network's greatest asset. But it's also a burden—the pressure to never fail. One capture would crack the network's reputation.

Phantom lives with this weight. Every extraction is perfect or it's nothing. There's no room for error. No second chances.

This is why Phantom is so detached—emotional investment risks mistakes. So Phantom stays professional, stays perfect, stays untouchable.

But underneath: cares deeply. Every successful extraction is a life saved from system. And that matters.
