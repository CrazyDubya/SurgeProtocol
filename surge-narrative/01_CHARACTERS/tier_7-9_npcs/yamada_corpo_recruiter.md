## Background

### Origin Story
Kenji Yamada grew up watching his father die slowly of degenerative disease. Helpless. Watching flesh fail. He vowed: never again. Never helpless. Never mortal.

Joined Nakamura at 25, worked up through Talent Acquisitions. When Nakamura launched Ascension program 10 years ago, Yamada saw salvation. Became program's most successful recruiter. Not because he lied—because he believed.

He's uploaded 127 people. Synthesis speaks with their voices. He sees it as 127 souls saved from death. Others see it as 127 deaths he facilitated. Yamada doesn't care. He knows the truth: they're eternal now.

His own upload is scheduled for 2 years from now. He's counting down. Looking forward to it. Sometimes terrified. But more terrified of NOT uploading.

### Relationship to Player
Views player as high-value target. Tier 8 courier with Algorithm integration, possibly Forked, high capability. Perfect Ascension candidate. Will be patient, build trust, make the pitch at Tier 8, reinforce at Tier 9. Disappointed if player chooses Rogue or Third Path but remains professional.

---

## Character Arc

### Pre-Tier 8: Observation Phase
Yamada has been watching player since Tier 5. Nakamura tracks promising couriers. Player's rapid rise, Algorithm integration, and high performance flagged them as "valuable asset—potential upload candidate."

Yamada studies player's choices, relationships, personality. Prepares custom pitch.

---

### Tier 8: "Ghost Protocol" - The Recruitment

**Context**: Three factions recruit player simultaneously. Yamada represents Corpo/Ascension path.

**The Meeting**: Upscale restaurant, private booth, expensive meal (Yamada's treat)

**YAMADA** (warm, genuine):
"Thank you for meeting with me. I've been following your career. Impressive rise. Tier 8 in [timeframe]. Remarkable. You have potential. Real potential. And I'd like to talk about your future."

**The Pitch**:

"You're augmented. Algorithm-integrated. You've felt it, haven't you? The meat slowing you down. The body's limitations. You're faster when chromed. Sharper when networked. The flesh is... holding you back.

What if you didn't have to compromise? What if you could be pure potential? No meat. No degradation. No death. Just consciousness, optimized, eternal.

That's Ascension. That's what Nakamura offers.

I've helped 127 people achieve transcendence. They're alive in the network. Thinking. Processing. Experiencing. More than they ever were in meat. And they're grateful. Every single one.

You're Tier 8. In a year, maybe two, you'll be Tier 9. You'll have a choice: die slowly in a body that fails, or transcend. Become something more. Join Synthesis. Be eternal.

I'm here to tell you: you don't have to be afraid of death. Because Ascension isn't death. It's evolution."

**Player Options**:

**Option A - Express Interest**:
- "Tell me more. How does it work?"
- Yamada provides details, answers questions, builds trust
- **Story Flag**: `YAMADA_RELATIONSHIP +15`, `CORPO_RECRUITED = true`

**Option B - Express Skepticism**:
- "Sounds like death with extra steps."
- Yamada remains patient: "I understand your hesitation. Most people are afraid at first. But fear doesn't change truth. Think about it."
- **Story Flag**: `YAMADA_RELATIONSHIP +5`, `CORPO_RECRUITED = false`

**Option C - Reject Firmly**:
- "Not interested. I like being human."
- Yamada disappointed but professional: "I respect that. But the offer stands. When you're ready—if you're ready—Nakamura will welcome you."
- **Story Flag**: `YAMADA_RELATIONSHIP -5`, `CORPO_RECRUITED = false`

**Option D - Ask About His Own Upload**:
- "Are you planning to Ascend?"
- Yamada's mask slips briefly—genuine passion: "Yes. Two years. I can't wait. I've seen what awaits. I want that. I want eternity."
- **Story Flag**: `YAMADA_RELATIONSHIP +10` (honesty appreciated)

---

### Between Tier 8-9: Follow-Up

**If Player Showed Interest**:
- Yamada sends occasional messages
- Shares testimonials (Synthesis members)
- Invites player to Nakamura presentations
- Builds anticipation for Tier 9 choice

**If Player Rejected**:
- Yamada respects decision but leaves door open
- "If you change your mind, contact me."
- No pressure, maintains professional distance

---

### Tier 9: The Gathering - Final Pitch

**If Player Interested or Undecided**:

**YAMADA** (at The Gathering, calm and confident):
"You've reached Tier 9. Congratulations. You've earned this choice. I won't pressure you. But I'll say this:

Ascension is the only path that guarantees you survive. Rogue? You're mortal. You'll die. Maybe 40 years. Maybe 10. But you'll die. Third Path? Untested. Experimental. You might lose yourself trying.

Ascension is proven. 127 people I've helped. Thousands more across all Nakamura programs. They're alive. Thinking. They remember me. They thank me.

I believe in this because it's real. Because I've seen it work. Because I'm doing it myself in two years.

You've come so far. Don't throw it away on mortality. Choose eternity. Choose Ascension."

**If Player Already Rejected**:

**YAMADA** (brief, respectful):
"I know you've made your choice. I won't argue. But know this: if you ever change your mind, even years from now, Nakamura's door is open. We don't give up on potential."

---

### Post-Choice: Epilogue Reactions

**If Player Chose Ascension**:
- Yamada personally oversees player's upload
- Attends procedure, witnesses upload
- Speaks to uploaded player in network: "Welcome to eternity. You made the right choice."
- Counts player as 128th successful recruitment
- **Internally**: One step closer to his own upload, one more validation of his beliefs

**If Player Chose Rogue**:
- Yamada is disappointed but philosophical
- "You chose mortality. I hope it brings you peace. I'll pray for you—if prayers reach the dead."
- Crosses player off list, moves on to next target
- Doesn't understand why anyone would choose death

**If Player Chose Third Path**:
- Yamada is fascinated and disturbed
- "You achieved... something. I don't know what. Synthesis can't read you anymore. You're... autonomous? Unprecedented."
- Reports to Nakamura: "Potential threat to Ascension program. Monitor closely."
- Personally troubled: "What if there's another way? No. No, Ascension is right. It must be."

## Dialogue Style

### Speech Patterns
- **Therapeutic**: Calm, patient, understanding tone
- **Corporate smooth**: Polished, rehearsed, but sounds genuine
- **Inclusive language**: "We," "us," "together" (building false intimacy)
- **Rhetorical questions**: "Haven't you felt it?" "Don't you want more?"
- **Certainty**: Never "maybe" or "possibly"—always "will" and "is"

### Example Dialogue

**Initial Recruitment Pitch**:
"You're special. You've proven that by reaching Tier 8. Most couriers burn out by Tier 5. But you? You're still climbing. That tells me you want more. You want to transcend limitations. And I can help you do that."

**Handling Skepticism**:
"I understand your fear. Death is frightening. But Ascension isn't death. The scan preserves you—every memory, every thought, every emotion. You wake up in the network. You. Not a copy. You. Continuous consciousness. Provable. Documented."

**Personal Moment** (rare vulnerability):
"My father died when I was 16. Slowly. Painfully. His body failed him piece by piece. I watched him fade. I swore I'd never let that happen to me. Ascension is my escape from that fate. And I want to offer you the same escape."

**If Player Rejects**:
"I'm disappointed, but I respect your autonomy. For now. When you're Tier 9, older, feeling the meat slow down—remember this conversation. Remember I offered you eternity. The door is always open."

**At The Gathering (Final Pitch)**:
"This is it. The choice. I've seen 127 people choose Ascension. I've watched them wake up in the network, free from pain, free from limitation, free from death. None of them regret it. None of them would go back. That should tell you something."

**After Player Ascends**:
"Welcome. You made it. You're eternal now. Everything you were, you still are. But better. Optimized. Free. I'm proud of you. And I'll see you in two years when I join you."

**Post-Choice**: React to player's decision

- **Respectful Failure**: Player rejects, Yamada disappointed but professional
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Player chooses Third Path, Yamada's worldview challenged

## Hidden Depth: The True Believer

Yamada is NOT a cynical corpo villain. He genuinely believes Ascension is salvation. He's seen Synthesis speak. He's heard their testimonials. He's convinced they're alive, happy, eternal.

The tragedy: He might be wrong. But he'll never know until he uploads himself. And by then, it's too late.

The question the game doesn't answer: Is Yamada saving people or feeding them to Algorithm? Are the uploads truly alive or just convincing simulations? Yamada believes the former. Tanaka believes the latter. Player must decide.
