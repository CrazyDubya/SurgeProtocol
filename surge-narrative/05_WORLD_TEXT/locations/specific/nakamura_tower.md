## Environmental Storytelling

**Corporate Power Manifest**:
- Scale intimidates (you are small)
- Security reminds (you are watched)
- Luxury displays (you are not worthy... yet)
- Ascension floors clean = death made beautiful

**Employee Reality**:
- Lower floors: Workers grinding (exploitation visible)
- Mid floors: Management complicit (benefiting from system)
- Ascension floors: True believers (Yamada) + unwilling participants (Tanaka)

**Upload Horror**:
- Sterile environment (death sanitized)
- Medical equipment (industrial death process)
- Consent forms (legal cover for murder?)
- Synthesis servers (digital coffins or digital heaven?)

---

## Thematic Role

**Represents**:
- **Corpo Power**: Physical manifestation of Nakamura dominance
- **Ascension Central**: Where transcendence/death happens
- **Class Hierarchy**: Floor = status (lower = worthless, higher = valuable)
- **The Lie**: Beautiful exterior, exploitation interior

**Symbol**:
- Visible from entire city (constant reminder)
- Aspiration target (climb tiers → enter tower)
- Trap destination (reach tower → offered death)
- Ambiguous ending (is Ascension salvation or horror? Tower doesn't answer)

---

## Atmospheric Notes

**Oppressive Scale**:
- Player feels small (design intent)
- Elevators feel like being swallowed
- Higher floors = further from humanity

**Corporate Sterility**:
- Everything clean = lifeless
- Perfection = artificial
- Control = omnipresent

**Upload Horror**:
- Medical = industrial
- Clinical = cold
- Beautiful = terrifying
