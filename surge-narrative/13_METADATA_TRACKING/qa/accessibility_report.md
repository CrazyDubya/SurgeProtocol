## SECTION 5: AGENCY DISTRIBUTION

### Who Has Agency?

| Marginalized groups | Medium | Not solely victims |

### Power Distribution

| Group | Powerful Characters | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|----|
| Corporations | Yamada, Victoria Cross | Antagonists, nuanced |
| Workers | Lopez, Union | Heroes, effective |
| Outcasts | Okonkwo, Solomon | Wise, respected |
| Youth | Jin, Player | Competent, learning |
