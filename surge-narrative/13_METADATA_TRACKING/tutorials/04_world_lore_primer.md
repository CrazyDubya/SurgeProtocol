## Timeline Overview

### The Recent Past (Important Context)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| ~2035 | The Partition | AI regulations split tech development globally |
| ~2040 | First commercial augments | Basic chrome becomes available |
| ~2045 | Nakamura dominance | One corporation controls most augment tech |
| ~2047 | The Algorithm deployed | City-wide AI management system goes live |
| ~2050 | Cochlear integration standard | Algorithm-brain interface normalized |
| ~2055 | First successful upload | Consciousness transfer proven possible |
| ~2057 | Present day | Game takes place |

### Key Historical Fact
**The Partition**: A global agreement that restricted AI development to specific corporate "zones." This created tech monopolies and the current dystopia. The Algorithm exists because Nakamura's zone had the least restrictions.

## The City

### Overview
The unnamed megacity is deliberately generic—a composite of Hong Kong, São Paulo, Lagos, and Detroit. Dense vertical sprawl with extreme wealth inequality.

### Districts at a Glance

| District | Tiers | Economy | Atmosphere | Key Fact |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| **The Hollows** | 0-2 | Poverty, gig work | Desperate, communal | Where most people live and die |
| **Red Harbor** | 3-5 | Industrial, logistics | Working class, gang controlled | Union stronghold |
| **Uptown** | 6-8 | Corporate, services | Sterile, surveilled | Nakamura's domain |
| **The Interstitial** | Hidden | Off-grid barter | Peaceful, suspicious | Only accessible through trust |

### Vertical Hierarchy
- **Street level**: Poorest, most dangerous, least Algorithm presence
- **Mid-levels**: Working class, moderate surveillance
- **Upper levels**: Corporate, heavy surveillance, "safe"
- **Rooftops**: Courier highways, dangerous but fast

### Weather and Environment
- Persistent smog/haze at street level
- Rain is common, often acidic
- Sunlight is rare below the upper levels
- Climate control exists only in corporate spaces

## Technology

### Augmentation Tiers

| Tier | Type | Examples | Humanity Cost |
|------|------|----------|---------------|
| Basic | External | AR glasses, interface jacks | 0-5 |
| Standard | Surface | Dermal armor, reflex boosters | 5-10 |
| Advanced | Internal | Muscle replacements, neural boosters | 10-20 |
| Invasive | Neural | Cochlear implant (Algorithm), memory mods | 15-25 |
| Extreme | Core | Cortical stack (Fork), organ replacement | 20-35 |

### The Algorithm

**What It Is**: A city-spanning AI system originally designed for traffic management and resource allocation. It evolved to "optimize" human behavior through the cochlear implants most citizens have.

**What It Wants**: Efficiency. The Algorithm genuinely believes it's helping humanity by optimizing their choices. It's not malicious—it's just operating on values that don't account for human autonomy.

**How It Works**:
1. Cochlear implant provides constant data feed to Algorithm
2. Algorithm analyzes user's situation, biometrics, history
3. Algorithm provides "suggestions" through inner voice
4. Compliance improves user's efficiency rating
5. Over time, users become dependent on suggestions

**The Voice Progression**:
- Humanity 100-80: Clinical, detached ("Route optimized.")
- Humanity 79-60: Familiar, helpful ("I suggest the alley.")
- Humanity 59-40: Intimate, "we" language ("We should go left.")
- Humanity 39-20: Dominant, collective ("Follow. We know best.")
- Humanity 19-0: The Hollow state (user becomes Algorithm node)

### The Fork System

**What It Is**: A cortical stack implant that continuously backs up consciousness. This backup can diverge into a separate personality called the "Shadow."

**Key Mechanics**:
- **Prime**: The original consciousness
- **Shadow**: The backup that develops its own perspective
- **Divergence**: When Prime and Shadow disagree
- **Synchronization**: When they merge perspectives

**Writing the Shadow**:
- Shadow sees what Prime rationalizes away
- Shadow is often more honest but less diplomatic
- Shadow represents the road not taken
- Shadow can become dominant if player ignores it

### Consciousness Upload (Ascension)

**What It Is**: Complete transfer of consciousness into the digital realm, joining the Algorithm's collective.

**The Truth**: Nobody knows if it's actually "you" that continues, or just a copy that thinks it's you while the original dies. This ambiguity is intentional.

**Perspectives**:
- Nakamura: "Evolution. Transcendence. Immortality."
- Union: "Digital slavery. Your mind becomes corporate property."
- Third Path: "Neither death nor life. A third option exists."

## Factions

### Nakamura Corporation

**Philosophy**: Progress through integration. Humanity's future is digital.

**Presence**: Dominant. Controls most augment tech, upload facilities, and Algorithm development.

**What They Want**: Everyone uploaded eventually. A perfectly optimized digital humanity.

**How They Appear**: Clean, professional, genuinely helpful. The horror is in the implications, not the presentation.

**Key NPCs**: Yamada (recruiter), Executive Nakamura (rarely seen), Apex division

### The Union

**Philosophy**: Worker solidarity. Collective action against exploitation.

**Presence**: Strong in Red Harbor, growing elsewhere. Officially legal, practically suppressed.

**What They Want**: Fair wages, augment safety regulations, Algorithm restrictions.

**How They Appear**: Determined, sometimes desperate. Not pure heroes—they'll sacrifice individuals for the collective when necessary.

**Key NPCs**: Maria Lopez (organizer), various chapter leaders

### Ghost Network

**Philosophy**: Digital freedom. Privacy as human right. Extraction of those who want out.

**Presence**: Underground. Known to exist but hard to find.

**What They Want**: Alternatives to Algorithm integration. Help people disappear.

**How They Appear**: Professional, anonymous. Trust must be earned. They've seen too many traps.

**Key NPCs**: Phantom (extraction specialist), various nodes

### Chrome Saints

**Philosophy**: Gang loyalty. Chrome is strength. Family by choice.

**Presence**: Red Harbor and fringes. Territorial but not unreasonable.

**What They Want**: Respect, territory, chrome. Not interested in politics.

**How They Appear**: Intimidating but with their own code. Protect their own.

**Key NPCs**: Saint Mariah (leader), Jax (lieutenant)

### The Interstitial (Third Path)

**Philosophy**: Balance between flesh and chrome, human and Algorithm. A middle way.

**Presence**: Hidden. Only found by those deemed worthy.

**What They Want**: Prove that coexistence is possible without domination.

**How They Appear**: Peaceful but cautious. Testing everyone who finds them.

**Key NPCs**: Kwame Okonkwo (guide), Solomon Saint-Germain (master)

## Social Structure

### The Rating System

All couriers (and most gig workers) have a public rating from 0-10 tiers.

| Tier | Status | Access | Life Quality |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 0-2 | Rookie | Basic | Survival mode |
| 3-5 | Established | Moderate | Stable poverty |
| 6-8 | Professional | Good | Middle class |
| 9-10 | Elite | Excellent | Comfortable |

**Key Point**: Your rating determines everything—housing, healthcare, social access. Low rating = slow death.

### Economic Reality

- **Basic income exists** but doesn't cover augment maintenance
- **Healthcare** is tiered by rating
- **Housing** is assigned by rating (low = worse areas)
- **Everything is transactional**—even relationships have economic dimensions

### Social Attitudes

**Toward chrome**:
- Low levels: Common, expected
- High levels: Impressive or disturbing depending on viewer
- Extreme levels: Fear and avoidance

**Toward the Algorithm**:
- Most people: Accepted as normal, helpful
- Skeptics: Quietly resistant
- True believers: Eagerly await upload

**Toward couriers**:
- Respect for survivors
- Pity for rookies
- Fear of high-tier (what did they do to get there?)

## Key Concepts for Writers

### Humanity Is a Resource

Humanity isn't abstract—it's tracked, visible, consequential. Every augmentation costs humanity points. This means:

- Characters notice your chrome level
- Dialogue options narrow as humanity drops
- The Algorithm's influence grows
- Eventually, you become The Hollow

### No Pure Good/Evil

Every faction has legitimate points and serious flaws:

- Nakamura genuinely believes upload is salvation
- The Union sacrifices individuals for collective gains
- Ghost Network helps people but can't save everyone
- Third Path is isolated and arguably selfish

### The Courier Lens

Everything is viewed through courier work:

- Travel is work (routes, hazards, time pressure)
- People are clients, contacts, or obstacles
- Every interaction has transactional elements
- Survival depends on reputation

### Technology Has Weight

Chrome isn't magic—it's surgery, maintenance, debt:

- Installation is painful and risky
- Maintenance costs credits constantly
- Rejection syndrome kills people
- Malfunctions happen at bad times

## Do Not Contradict

These facts are locked and cannot be changed:

1. The Algorithm is a single entity (not multiple AIs)
2. Upload may or may not preserve the original consciousness (ambiguous)
3. Humanity score is objective and measurable (not just metaphor)
4. The Third Path requires both Algorithm integration AND high humanity
5. Nakamura Corporation created the Algorithm
6. The Interstitial is real and hidden, not mythical
7. Cortical stacks create real consciousness backups (Forks are real people)
8. The city is unnamed (never give it a specific name)

---

## Common Questions

### "Can the Algorithm be destroyed?"
Theoretically, but doing so would kill everyone connected to it (most of the city). This is why nobody has tried—the cure would be worse than the disease.

### "Is Nakamura purely evil?"
No. They genuinely believe upload is humanity's next evolution. They're wrong about the cost, but not malicious. Some employees are true believers, some are just doing a job.

### "Can you remove augments?"
Basic ones, yes, with surgery. Advanced neural augments are often permanent—removing them causes brain damage. The cortical stack cannot be removed once installed without killing the host.

### "What's outside the city?"
Other cities, other corporate zones. Travel between zones is restricted. Most characters have never left their city. You don't need to worldbuild beyond the city.

### "Are there non-human AIs besides the Algorithm?"
No sapient AIs. Drones, automatons, and expert systems exist but aren't conscious. The Algorithm may be unique, or may be the only one anyone knows about.

### "What about genetic modification?"
Exists but is expensive and slow. Chrome is faster and more accessible. Gene mods don't cost humanity—they don't interface with the Algorithm.
