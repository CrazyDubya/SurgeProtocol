# Surge Protocol: Writer Onboarding Guide

## Welcome to the Narrative Team

Welcome to the Surge Protocol narrative team. This guide will help you understand our world, themes, and writing standards so you can create content that integrates seamlessly with our existing narrative framework.

**Before You Begin**: Read this guide fully before writing any content. Understanding our core themes and tone is essential for maintaining consistency across our 100,000+ words of existing narrative.

## Project Overview

### What is Surge Protocol?

Surge Protocol is a **cyberpunk text-based RPG** set in a near-future where consciousness can be digitized, identity is malleable, and humanity itself has become a resource to be spent. You play as a courier navigating a gig economy where your literal mind can be upgraded, copied, or absorbed by a city-spanning AI called The Algorithm.

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Accept delivery missions** from your dispatcher
2. **Navigate** dangerous urban environments
3. **Make choices** that affect your humanity, relationships, and faction standing
4. **Upgrade** your body with augmentations (at the cost of humanity)
5. **Progress** through a 10-tier rating system
6. **Choose** one of three endings: Ascension (merge with AI), Rogue (escape the system), or Third Path (balance both worlds)

### The Central Question

Every piece of content should connect to our thematic question:

> **"What are you willing to trade for survival? And what remains of you when the trade is done?"**

## Narrative Pillars

These five pillars define every narrative decision in Surge Protocol. Reference them when writing.

### 1. Identity Erosion

The more you upgrade, the less of "you" remains. This isn't metaphorical - augmentations literally cost humanity points. Players should feel the weight of each enhancement.

**Writing Guidance**:
- NPCs should comment on player's changing appearance/behavior
- The Algorithm's voice changes as humanity decreases
- Dialogue options narrow as humanity drops
- High-chrome NPCs should feel subtly "off"

### 2. The Gig Economy Dystopia

Everything is transactional. Your rating determines your worth. The system exploits workers while claiming to empower them. There are no heroes, only survivors making impossible choices.

**Writing Guidance**:
- No character is purely good or evil
- Economic pressure drives most decisions
- The rating system should feel oppressive but seductive
- Even "good" factions have blood on their hands

### 3. Technological Body Horror

Augmentation isn't clean or magical. It's surgery, rejection risk, maintenance costs, and the creeping question of whether your thoughts are still your own. Chrome has weight.

**Writing Guidance**:
- Describe augmentation physically (scars, ports, glowing interfaces)
- Include maintenance concerns (calibration, rejection, malfunction)
- The Algorithm's presence should feel invasive
- Show the visceral cost of upgrading

### 4. Surveillance Capitalism

The Algorithm isn't evil - it's optimizing. It genuinely believes it's helping. This makes it more disturbing than a simple villain. Everyone is being watched, measured, and nudged toward "optimal" outcomes.

**Writing Guidance**:
- The Algorithm offers genuinely useful advice
- Its suggestions slowly become demands
- Privacy is a luxury no one can afford
- Data is the real currency

### 5. Found Humanity

Despite the darkness, moments of genuine connection exist. The Union organizers helping each other. The shop owner who fixes your chrome without reporting it. The Interstitial community living off-grid. These moments matter precisely because they're rare.

**Writing Guidance**:
- Earn emotional moments through consistent characterization
- Small kindnesses should feel significant
- Not every NPC is broken or cynical
- Hope exists, but it's hard-won

## The World of Surge Protocol

### Setting: The City

An unnamed megacity, deliberately generic enough to feel universal. Four main districts:

| District | Tier Range | Atmosphere | Key Locations |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **The Hollows** | 0-2 | Poverty, mutual aid, desperation | Chen's Dispatch, Rosa's Shop |
| **Red Harbor** | 3-5 | Industrial, gang territory, union organizing | Docks, Union Hall, Chrome Saints territory |
| **Uptown Corporate** | 6-8 | Sterile, surveilled, ascending | Nakamura Tower, Upload Clinics, Apex HQ |
| **The Interstitial** | Hidden | Off-grid sanctuary, Third Path home | Solomon's Sanctum, The Workshop |

### The Algorithm

The city-spanning AI that "helps" couriers through their cochlear implants. It's not evil - it's optimizing for survival and productivity. Key characteristics:

- **Clinical at high humanity**: Efficient, detached, helpful
- **Intimate at mid humanity**: Uses your name, anticipates needs, becomes "we"
- **Dominant at low humanity**: Speaks as collective, player's thoughts blur with Algorithm's
- **Five distinct voice stages** based on humanity score

### Factions

| Faction | Philosophy | Relationship |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Nakamura Corporation** | Progress through Ascension | Employers, eventual absorption |
| **The Union** | Worker solidarity, collective action | Allies against exploitation |
| **Ghost Network** | Digital freedom, extraction | Rogue path enablers |
| **Chrome Saints** | Gang loyalty, chrome worship | Street power, neutral |
| **The Interstitial** | Balance, Third Path | Secret alternative |

### The Fork System

At Tier 6, players can install a cortical stack that creates a backup of their consciousness. This backup (the "Shadow") develops its own personality and may conflict with the "Prime" (original). The Fork system enables:

- Internal dialogue between Prime and Shadow
- Divergent advice from two versions of yourself
- Identity crisis gameplay
- Multiple resolution paths (Prime dominant, Shadow dominant, or synchronized)

---

## Character Writing Guidelines

### Voice Consistency

Each NPC should have distinctive speech patterns. Use these markers:

**Vocabulary Level**:
- Street characters: Slang, contractions, incomplete sentences
- Corporate characters: Jargon, formal structures, euphemisms
- Academic characters: Precise, technical, measured

**Sentence Structure**:
- Nervous characters: Short, fragmented
- Confident characters: Complete, declarative
- Philosophical characters: Complex, questioning

**Unique Markers**:
- Chen calls everyone "kid"
- Tanaka uses medical terminology casually
- Okonkwo speaks in questions and metaphors
- The Algorithm uses "we" at low humanity

### Relationship Progression

NPCs remember player actions. Relationship values (-100 to +100) affect:

| Range | Greeting Style | Content Access | Tone |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------|
| -100 to -50 | Hostile | Minimal | Fear/Anger |
| -49 to -20 | Cold | Basic | Distrust |
| -19 to +19 | Neutral | Standard | Professional |
| +20 to +50 | Warm | Expanded | Friendly |
| +51 to +80 | Close | Personal | Trusting |
| +81 to +100 | Intimate | Full | Deep connection |

### Humanity-Based Reactions

NPCs should react differently based on player's humanity score:

**High Humanity (80-100)**: NPCs are comfortable, treat player as human
**Mid Humanity (60-79)**: Subtle discomfort, comments on "changes"
**Low Humanity (40-59)**: Visible unease, avoid eye contact, nervous
**Critical Humanity (<40)**: Fear, avoid interaction, speak carefully

---

## Dialogue Writing Standards

### Node Structure

Every dialogue follows this structure:

```
NPC_LINE → PLAYER_RESPONSE_HUB → NPC_REACTION → (repeat or EXIT)
```

### Line Length Guidelines

- **NPC lines**: 1-3 sentences maximum
- **Player responses**: 5-12 words
- **Skill check results**: 1-2 sentences
- **Narration**: 1 sentence

### Tone Tags

Every player response needs a tone tag:

| Tag | Usage | Relationship Effect |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| FRIENDLY | Warm, agreeable | Usually positive |
| NEUTRAL | Professional, direct | No change |
| AGGRESSIVE | Threatening, angry | Usually negative |
| SARCASTIC | Deflecting, humor | Context-dependent |
| FLIRTATIOUS | Romantic interest | Romance-specific |
| EMPATHETIC | Understanding, kind | Positive if genuine |
| DECEPTIVE | Lies, manipulation | Negative if caught |

### Skill Check Integration

When writing skill checks:

```markdown
**Player Option**: [SKILL_TYPE] "Dialogue text here."
- **Difficulty**: EASY(6) / MODERATE(9) / HARD(12) / VERY_HARD(15)
- **Success**: Description of positive outcome
- **Failure**: Description of negative outcome (should be interesting, not punishing)
```

**Available Skills**:
- DECEPTION: Lying, misdirection
- INTIMIDATION: Threats, displays of power
- EMPATHY: Understanding emotions, connecting
- TECH: Hacking, system knowledge
- PERCEPTION: Noticing details, reading situations
- STREETWISE: Urban navigation, underworld knowledge

---

## Quest Design Standards

### Three-Act Structure

Every quest follows:

**Act 1: Setup** (20% of content)
- Clear objective
- Stakes established
- Player agency in approach

**Act 2: Complication** (60% of content)
- Unexpected twist
- Moral dilemma
- Multiple solution paths

**Act 3: Resolution** (20% of content)
- Consequences of choices
- Relationship impacts
- Story flag updates

### Branching Philosophy

**The Rule of Three**: Major choice points should offer three distinct paths (not just "good/neutral/evil")

**Converging Branches**: 70% of branches reconverge to main story. Only 30% create truly divergent paths.

**Fail Forward**: Failed skill checks should create interesting alternative paths, not dead ends.

### Quest Types

| Type | Length | Branching | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Main Story | 20-30 min | High | Tier quests |
| Major Side | 15-20 min | Medium | Character quests |
| Minor Side | 5-10 min | Low | Faction errands |
| Daily | 2-5 min | Minimal | Delivery missions |

## Story Flag System

### Naming Convention

```
[TIER]_[ACTION]_[SUBJECT]
```

Examples:
- `T3_ACCEPTED_ALGORITHM` - Tier 3, accepted Algorithm integration
- `T6_SPARED_JIN` - Tier 6, let Jin live
- `ROSA_ROMANCE_ACTIVE` - Rosa romance path active

### Flag Types

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Boolean | true/false | `ALGORITHM_INTEGRATED` |
| Integer | -100 to +100 | `CHEN_RELATIONSHIP` |
| String | enum values | `ENDING_TYPE: "ascension"` |

### Checking Flags

Before writing conditional content, check existing flags in:
`/13_METADATA_TRACKING/story_flags_master_list.md`

### Creating New Flags

When creating new flags:
1. Check master list for existing similar flags
2. Use consistent naming convention
3. Document in your content file
4. Add to master list after review

## File Naming Conventions

### Character Files
```
[tier_range]_npcs/[character_name].md
Example: tier_0_npcs/dispatcher_chen.md
```

### Quest Files

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Power Fantasy Writing
**Wrong**: Player is the chosen one, special hero who saves everyone
**Right**: Player is a courier making hard choices to survive

### 2. Clear Moral Binaries
**Wrong**: Help the innocent OR help the villain
**Right**: Help one innocent group while harming another innocent group

### 3. Text Walls
**Wrong**: NPCs deliver 5-paragraph explanations
**Right**: NPCs speak in 1-3 sentences, information delivered across multiple exchanges

### 4. Inconsistent Character Voice
**Wrong**: Chen suddenly speaks formally or uses slang he wouldn't know
**Right**: Chen always calls people "kid", speaks in clipped sentences

### 5. Ignoring Humanity System
**Wrong**: NPC treats player the same at 90 humanity and 30 humanity
**Right**: NPC reactions shift dramatically based on player's chrome level

### 6. Forgetting Economic Reality
**Wrong**: Characters make decisions without considering credits/survival
**Right**: Even good people make bad choices when rent is due
