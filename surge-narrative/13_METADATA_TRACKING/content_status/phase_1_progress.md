2. ✅ Create Algorithm voice system
3. ✅ Create 2 critical path quests (Tier 0, Tier 3)
4. 🚧 Create content tracking (this file)
5. ⏸️ Commit Phase 1 initial content

### Next Session:
1. Create Solomon Saint-Germain (Third Path NPC)
2. Create Synthesis (Ascended NPC)
3. Write Tier 6 quest (Cortical Stack)
4. Write Tier 9 quest (Final Choice)
5. Write Tier 10 + Epilogue variations

## Risks & Blockers

### Current Risks:
1. **Scope**: Phase 1 still requires ~8-10 more major content pieces
2. **Consistency**: Story flags need careful tracking across files
3. **Tone**: Maintaining bleak-but-hopeful balance
4. **Branching**: Multiple paths create content multiplication

### Mitigations:
1. **Prioritize critical path**: Tier 6, 9, 10 must be done first
2. **Use templates**: Speeds up remaining NPCs/quests
3. **Centralize flags**: Create story flag master list
4. **Streamline Tiers 1,2,4,5,7,8**: Linear, less branching

---

## Definition of Done: Phase 1

Phase 1 is complete when:
- [ ] All 10 core NPCs have complete character sheets
- [ ] All 12 critical path quests are written (Tier 0-10 + Epilogue)
- [ ] Algorithm voice system is complete (✅ DONE)
- [ ] Essential dialogue trees exist for greetings/farewells
- [ ] 15 basic complications are written
- [ ] Tutorial content covers core mechanics
- [ ] Story flags are tracked in master document
- [ ] Playable vertical slice: Tier 0 → Tier 10 with one path

**Target**: End of Week 4
**Current Progress**: 30%
**On Track**: Partial (need to accelerate NPC/quest creation)

## Notes for Writers

### What's Working:
- **Template system**: Makes character creation fast and consistent
- **Depth**: Characters feel real, with motivations and arcs
- **Algorithm voice**: Creepy, effective, shows degradation
- **Quests**: Clear structure, meaningful choices, consequences

### Areas to Improve:
- **Speed**: Need to create content faster while maintaining quality
- **Interconnection**: Ensure NPCs reference each other
- **Story flags**: Track carefully to avoid contradictions
- **Line count**: Be realistic—don't under-estimate VA needs

### Writing Tips:
- Use the templates religiously
- Reference other files (maintain consistency)
- Think about player agency (always give choice)
- Humanity thresholds matter (dialogue should change)
- Every choice should have weight
- No pure good outcomes (gray morality)
