## Session 3 Plan: Linear Progression Quests

### Target: Tier 1, 2, 4, 5 Quests (4 quests)

These quests connect the major milestones and should be:
- **Simpler** than milestone quests (less branching)
- **Focused** on progression mechanics and story advancement
- **Character-building** moments with NPCs
- **Thematically consistent** with the overall arc

#### **Tier 1: Fresh Meat**
- **Purpose**: Post-tutorial progression, establish rating system stakes
- **Theme**: You're competing against other couriers, survival of the fittest
- **Key Moment**: First rival encounter, first rating pressure
- **Complexity**: Linear with 2-3 minor choices
- **NPCs**: Chen, Rosa (establishing relationships)

#### **Tier 2: Provisional**
- **Purpose**: Mid-early game, introduce faction contacts
- **Theme**: The gig economy grind, corpo influence
- **Key Moment**: First faction contract offer, first moral gray choice
- **Complexity**: Linear with faction introduction
- **NPCs**: Chen, introduce Fixer Delilah or corpo contact

#### **Tier 4: Gray**
- **Purpose**: Post-Algorithm integration, settling into new normal
- **Theme**: Gray market economy, moral compromise
- **Key Moment**: Player accepts morally questionable contract
- **Complexity**: 2 paths (accept compromise or refuse)
- **NPCs**: Gray market contacts, Algorithm commentary

#### **Tier 5: The Space Between**
- **Purpose**: Pre-cortical stack, introduction to Interstitial
- **Theme**: Hidden infrastructure, things between the official world
- **Key Moment**: First glimpse of Interstitial, meet Okonkwo

- **NPCs**: Okonkwo (Interstitial guide), foreshadows Tier 6-9 content

---

## Session 4 Plan: Late-Game Progression + NPCs

### Target: Tier 7, 8 Quests + 2 NPCs (4 items)

#### **Tier 7: The Consultation**
- **Purpose**: Post-cortical stack, Algorithm confrontation
- **Theme**: Divergence crisis, Shadow vs. Prime conflict
- **Key Moment**: Direct conversation with Algorithm (not just voice in head)
- **Complexity**: Fork-dependent (different if player refused)
- **NPCs**: Algorithm manifestation, Shadow (if Forked)

#### **Tier 8: Ghost Protocol**
- **Purpose**: Pre-final choice, all factions make offers
- **Theme**: "You're valuable now, everyone wants you"
- **Key Moment**: Faction recruitment attempts, Ghost Network contact
- **Complexity**: Multiple faction paths, sets up Tier 9
- **NPCs**: Faction representatives, Ghost Network

#### **Union Organizer Lopez**
- **Purpose**: Alternative path NPC, resistance voice
- **Theme**: Collective action vs. individual optimization
- **Role**: Offers Union augments, anti-corpo contracts, Rogue path support

#### **Okonkwo** (Interstitial Guide)
- **Purpose**: Guide to hidden spaces, brings player to Solomon
- **Theme**: Living between worlds, neutral observer
- **Role**: Connects Tier 5 → Tier 9, enables Third Path discovery

## Session 6 Plan: Complications & Polish

### Target: 15 Complications + Polish Pass

#### **Complications** (3 per category × 5 categories = 15)

**Environmental**:
1. Traffic disaster (gridlock, player must navigate chaos)
2. Infrastructure failure (bridge collapse, reroute urgency)
3. Weather hazard (storm, visibility, vehicle stress)

**Hostile Encounters**:
4. Police checkpoint (bribe/evade/comply)
5. Gang ambush (fight/flee/negotiate)
6. Rival courier (competition, sabotage)

**Cargo Issues**:
7. Fragile package breaking (time pressure, repair options)
8. Hazmat leak (contamination, health risk)
9. Contraband discovery (moral choice, legal risk)

**Moral Dilemmas**:
10. Cargo is wrong (weapon delivery to civilian area)
11. Innocent bystander (help stranger vs. stay on schedule)
12. Blackmail opportunity (exploit situation for gain)

**Technical Failures**:
13. Vehicle breakdown (repair/call Rosa/abandon)
14. Augment malfunction (chrome glitch, temporary disability)
15. Nav system hacked (lost, must navigate manually)

#### **Polish Tasks**:

## Risk Management

### Risk: Linear quests feel shallow compared to milestones
**Mitigation**: They should be simpler—they're connectors. Focus on character moments and thematic reinforcement rather than complex branching.

### Risk: Running out of time/energy
**Mitigation**: Prioritize critical path completion. Complications and tutorials can be minimal if needed.

### Risk: Losing thematic consistency
**Mitigation**: Each quest should ask: "How does this explore the core question: What are you willing to trade?"

---

## Next: Start Session 3

Create Tier 1, 2, 4, 5 quests focusing on:
- **Progression** (getting from Tier X to Tier X+1)
- **Character** (deepening relationships with NPCs)
- **Theme** (each quest explores aspect of chrome/humanity trade-off)
- **Simplicity** (2-3 choices max, not 5 branching paths)

Begin with Tier 1: Fresh Meat
