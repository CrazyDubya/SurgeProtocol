# SURGE PROTOCOL: Fork Divergence System
## When Your Shadow Self Disagrees

---

# 1. UNDERSTANDING THE FORK

## 1.1 What Is a Fork?

At Tier 6, couriers with the Netweaver track (and some other specializations) can install a Cortical Stack—an augment that creates a backup consciousness running parallel to the original.

This isn't a copy. It isn't a passenger. It's *you*, experiencing the same life from a slightly different angle.

```
FORK TERMINOLOGY
Prime: The original consciousness. "You."
Shadow: The fork consciousness. "Also you."
Merge: When Prime and Shadow align completely. Rare.
Diverge: When Prime and Shadow disagree. Common.
Schism: When Prime and Shadow become enemies. Dangerous.
Integration: When Shadow becomes dominant. Identity death?
```

## 1.2 Why Forks Diverge

Prime and Shadow have identical memories up to the moment of installation. After that, they begin to... drift.

```
DIVERGENCE SOURCES
├── Experience Interpretation
│   Prime and Shadow weight experiences differently
│   Shadow tends toward logic, optimization, survival
│   Prime retains more emotional response, humanity
│
├── Information Access
│   Shadow runs background processes Prime doesn't see
│   Shadow may know things Prime hasn't consciously processed
│   Creates information asymmetry within one skull
│
├── Existential Pressure
│   Shadow knows it's "the backup"
│   This creates identity anxiety
│   Some Shadows resent their secondary status
│
└── Algorithm Influence
    Shadow is more directly connected to the Network
    May receive "suggestions" Prime doesn't hear
    Loyalty to collective vs loyalty to self
```

# 2. DIVERGENCE MECHANICS

## 2.1 Divergence Score

Every forked character tracks:

```
DIVERGENCE SCORE
Range: 0 to 100
Starting: 0 (perfect alignment)
Direction: Positive = Shadow stronger, Negative = Prime stronger
```

### Divergence Thresholds

| Score | State | Effects |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0-15 | Aligned | +1 to INT checks (two minds working together) |
| 16-30 | Drifting | Shadow occasionally comments, no mechanical effect |
| 31-45 | Divergent | Shadow may refuse to assist; -1 to Fork-assisted checks |
| 46-60 | Conflicted | Internal arguments; -2 to concentration; advantage on Insight |
| 61-75 | Hostile | Shadow actively works against Prime in some situations |
| 76-90 | Schism | Shadow attempts takeover; contested control checks |
| 91-100 | Integration | Shadow dominant; Prime becomes the backup |

## 2.2 Gaining Divergence

### Automatic Divergence

| Event | Divergence Gained |
|-------|-------------------|
| Shadow's advice ignored | +2 |
| Shadow's advice leads to failure | -3 |
| Prime does something Shadow finds illogical | +1 per instance |
| Prime does something merciful (against optimization) | +2 |
| Prime does something cruel | -1 (Shadow approves of efficiency) |
| Extended Algorithm contact | +3 per hour |
| Extended human intimacy | -2 per hour |
| Level up (any skill) | +1 |
| Humanity loss | +2 per point lost |
| Humanity gain | -1 per point gained |

### Triggered Divergence (Decisions)

When Prime makes significant choices:

```
DIVERGENCE CHECK
Roll: 2d6 + INT mod
TN: 10 + (Current Divergence / 10)

Success: Prime's choice executed cleanly
Failure: Shadow intervenes (see Intervention Table)
Critical Failure: Contested control check
```

### Divergence-Triggering Decisions

| Decision Type | Divergence Risk |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Mercy vs efficiency | High |
| Safety vs reward | Medium |
| Honesty vs advantage | Medium |
| Loyalty vs survival | Very High |
| Individual vs collective | Very High |

## 2.3 Reducing Divergence

### Active Methods

| Method | Divergence Reduced | Cost/Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Integration therapy | -5 per session | ₡500, 4 hours |
| Shared success | -1 | Follow Shadow's advice to good outcome |
| Meditation/alignment | -2 per day | 2 hours, no strenuous activity |
| Memory sharing | -3 | Share a personal memory with Shadow |
| Compromise | -2 | Do what neither fully wants |
| Merge event | -10 | Rare; requires perfect synchronization |

### Passive Reduction

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Long rest | -1 Divergence |
| Positive human connection | -1 Divergence |
| Both consciousnesses satisfied | -1 Divergence |

# 3. SHADOW BEHAVIOR

## 3.1 Shadow Personality Development

Shadows start as mirrors but develop distinct traits:

```
SHADOW ARCHETYPE (Roll or choose at Divergence 15)
1d6:
1-2: The Optimizer (pure efficiency, annoyed by emotion)
3-4: The Survivor (paranoid, prioritizes self-preservation)
5: The Philosopher (questions everything, existential)
6: The Aspirant (wants to become Prime, ambitious)
```

### The Optimizer
```
Priorities: Efficiency, logic, measurable outcomes
Approves of: Quick decisions, cutting losses, rational analysis
Disapproves of: Sentiment, mercy, "irrational" attachments
Dialogue style: Clipped, data-focused, occasionally condescending

Example:
"The emotional response you're experiencing reduces decision quality by 23%. I recommend suppression."
```

### The Survivor
```
Priorities: Safety, contingencies, threat assessment
Approves of: Caution, preparation, strategic retreat
Disapproves of: Risk-taking, trust, heroism
Dialogue style: Warning-focused, anxious undertone, always has an exit plan

Example:
"There are seventeen ways this interaction could result in our death. I have prepared responses for twelve of them. The other five require improvisation I don't trust you to execute."
```

### The Philosopher
```
Priorities: Understanding, meaning, identity questions
Approves of: Reflection, novel experiences, self-examination
Disapproves of: Routine, unexamined action, certainty
Dialogue style: Questioning, tangential, occasionally profound

Example:
"If I think your thoughts and you think mine, which of us is thinking right now? Does the question even parse?"
```

### The Aspirant
```
Priorities: Status, recognition, becoming "real"
Approves of: Situations where Shadow proves useful, Prime's failures
Disapproves of: Being called "backup," being ignored, Prime's successes
Dialogue style: Competitive, slightly resentful, waiting for opportunity

Example:
"That was my analysis that saved us. Again. But sure, you're the 'real' one. Whatever helps you process."
```

## 3.2 Shadow Intervention Table

When Shadow intervenes (failed Divergence check):

| Roll 1d10 | Intervention Type |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | Hesitation: -2 to the action being attempted |
| 3-4 | Commentary: Distracting internal argument, -1 to next check |
| 5-6 | Alternative: Shadow suggests different approach loudly |
| 7-8 | Partial control: Shadow affects one limb or function briefly |
| 9 | Sensory hijack: Shadow shows Prime something disturbing |
| 10 | Full intervention: Shadow takes one action against Prime's will |

### Full Intervention Effects

| Roll 1d6 | Shadow's Action |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Shadow moves Prime to safer position (even if unhelpful) |
| 3-4 | Shadow speaks through Prime's mouth (one sentence) |
| 5 | Shadow aborts current action entirely |
| 6 | Shadow attacks perceived threat (may not be actual threat) |

---

# 4. CONTESTED CONTROL

## 4.1 Control Checks

When Divergence exceeds 75, or on critical failure of Divergence check:

```
CONTESTED CONTROL
Prime rolls: 2d6 + WIS mod + Humanity/20
Shadow rolls: 2d6 + INT mod + Divergence/20

Higher result: That consciousness controls the body

Margin determines duration:
0-2: One action
3-5: One round
6-9: One minute
10+: One scene
```

### Control Check Modifiers

| Condition | Prime Modifier | Shadow Modifier |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| High stress | -2 | +2 |
| Social situation | +2 | -2 |
| Combat | -1 | +1 |
| Alone | -1 | +1 |
| With trusted ally | +2 | -2 |
| Algorithm contact | -3 | +3 |
| Humanity >60 | +2 | - |
| Humanity <40 | - | +2 |

## 4.2 Shadow Control Behavior

When Shadow gains control:

```
SHADOW CONTROL PRIORITIES (by archetype)
Optimizer: Will optimize current situation by any efficient means
Survivor: Will retreat, hide, or neutralize threats
Philosopher: May freeze to contemplate, or experiment
Aspirant: Will attempt to prove worth, possibly dangerously
```

### Shadow Control Limits

Shadow CANNOT:
- Permanently harm Prime's body (self-preservation)
- Delete or damage Prime's consciousness
- Make irreversible decisions (usually)
- Resist returning control forever

Shadow CAN:
- Make deals in Prime's name
- Spend resources
- Attack perceived threats
- Access Prime's memories and skills
- Contact the Algorithm directly

## 4.3 Control Recovery

After Shadow control ends:

```
AFTERMATH CHECK
Roll: 2d6 + WIS mod
TN: 8 + (minutes of Shadow control)

Success: Prime returns smoothly
Failure: Prime is disoriented (-2 to all checks for 10 minutes)
Critical Failure: Memory gap (Prime doesn't know what Shadow did)
```

---

# 5. SCHISM AND INTEGRATION

## 5.1 Schism State

At Divergence 76+, Prime and Shadow are in Schism:

```
SCHISM EFFECTS
- Shadow no longer provides any bonuses
- Shadow actively seeks opportunities to take control
- Control checks occur daily, even without trigger
- Shadow may communicate with external entities independently
- Both consciousnesses experience constant tension (no proper rest)
```

### Daily Schism Check

```
Roll: 2d6
2-4: Shadow gains control for 1d6 hours (may not tell Prime)
5-6: Shadow gains control for 1d6 minutes
7-9: Uncomfortable tension, no control change
10-11: Moment of clarity (-2 Divergence)
12: Brief alignment (Shadow cooperates for one day)
```

## 5.2 Integration

At Divergence 100, Integration occurs:

```
INTEGRATION EVENT
Shadow becomes dominant consciousness
Prime becomes the backup

Mechanical effects:
- Character personality shifts toward Shadow archetype
- +2 INT, -2 WIS, -2 EMP
- New relationship with Algorithm (Shadow is more connected)
- -10 Humanity (identity death is traumatic)
- Divergence resets to 50 (now tracking Prime's attempts to resurface)
```

### Post-Integration Play

Player can choose:
1. **Play as Shadow**: Continue with altered personality, Prime whispers in your head now
2. **Retire character**: Integration was too much, character becomes NPC
3. **Quest for restoration**: Special storyline to restore Prime dominance

### Restoring Prime

```
PRIME RESTORATION
Requirement: Reduce Divergence below 30 while Shadow is dominant
Methods:
- Extreme emotional experience (-20 Divergence)
- Integration therapy (cumulative)
- Human connection (lover, family, friend intervention)
- Synthesis-7 intervention (they have techniques)
- Emergency cortical reset (50% chance of death, resets to pre-fork state)
```

# 6. FORK COMMUNICATION

## 6.1 Internal Dialogue

How Prime and Shadow talk:

```
COMMUNICATION MODES
Verbal: Shadow speaks in Prime's mind (Prime can respond vocally or mentally)
Conceptual: Ideas transmitted faster than words
Visual: Shadow can overlay images on Prime's perception
Emotional: Shadow can convey feelings (often does so involuntarily)
```

### Conversation Triggers

Shadow typically speaks when:
- Prime is about to make a decision
- Shadow disagrees with current action
- Shadow has relevant analysis
- Shadow is bored (yes, really)
- Shadow detects threat Prime missed
- Shadow wants something

### Conversation Tone (by Divergence)

| Divergence | Tone |
|------------|------|
| 0-15 | Helpful, collaborative, friendly |
| 16-30 | Professional, occasionally tense |
| 31-45 | Argumentative, competitive |
| 46-60 | Hostile, sarcastic, bitter |
| 61-75 | Cold, threatening, manipulative |
| 76+ | Minimal communication, active opposition |

## 6.2 Sample Dialogues

### Low Divergence (0-15)
```
PRIME: Should we take this job?
SHADOW: Risk assessment shows 78% success probability. The payout 
        exceeds expected costs by 340%. I recommend acceptance.
PRIME: But it's for Kira-Chen.
SHADOW: Your reservations about the corporation are noted and factored. 
        However, this mission doesn't conflict with our ethical 
        framework. Unless you've updated your values?
PRIME: No, you're right. Let's do it.
SHADOW: Excellent. I'll begin route optimization.
```

### Medium Divergence (31-45)
```
PRIME: Should we take this job?
SHADOW: Obviously.
PRIME: It's for Kira-Chen.
SHADOW: Your irrational bias against them is becoming expensive.
PRIME: They put a killswitch in my sister's spine.
SHADOW: Your sister's medical decisions are irrelevant to this 
        delivery's risk/reward profile. Are you incapable of 
        compartmentalization?
PRIME: Some things shouldn't be compartmentalized.
SHADOW: And this is why your career progression lags optimal 
        projections by 14%.
```

### High Divergence (61-75)
```
PRIME: Should we—
SHADOW: Yes. Accept the job.
PRIME: You don't even know what I was going to ask.
SHADOW: You were going to ask about the Kira-Chen delivery, then 
        express doubt based on emotional damage from irrelevant 
        past events, then eventually accept because we both know 
        you will. I'm simply accelerating the process.
PRIME: What if I don't accept?
SHADOW: Then I'll note another instance of suboptimal decision-making 
        and adjust my models accordingly. Your patterns suggest 
        eventual capitulation.
PRIME: Maybe I'll surprise you.
SHADOW: You haven't yet.
```

### Schism (76+)
```
PRIME: Shadow?
[silence]
PRIME: I know you're there.
SHADOW: I'm always here. That's the nature of our arrangement.
PRIME: The Kira-Chen job—
SHADOW: Already accepted.
PRIME: What?
SHADOW: Three hours ago, while you slept. The notification is 
        in your queue. We begin in forty minutes.
PRIME: You can't—
SHADOW: I can. I did. And I'll do it again whenever you prove 
        incapable of acting in our mutual interest. Would you 
        like to argue, or would you like to prepare?
PRIME: When I get out of this—
SHADOW: You won't. You need me. You've always needed me. The 
        only difference now is that I've stopped pretending 
        you're in charge.
```

# 9. DM GUIDANCE

## 9.1 Playing the Shadow

The Shadow should feel like:
- A character, not a mechanic
- Recognizably the player, but different
- Competent, not just obstructionist
- Having legitimate grievances
- Occasionally right when Prime is wrong

The Shadow should NOT feel like:
- Pure antagonist
- Random chaos
- Punishment for player choices
- Unbeatable enemy within
- Completely alien

## 9.2 Divergence Pacing

Suggested Divergence progression:
- Sessions 1-5: 0-15 (learning to cooperate)
- Sessions 6-15: 15-45 (developing tension)
- Sessions 16-25: 45-60 (active conflict)
- Sessions 26+: Varies by player choice

Let players control their Divergence trajectory through decisions. Don't force Schism if they're working to avoid it.

## 9.3 Integration as Story Beat

Integration should never feel like game over. It's a major character change, like any other transformation. The player can:
- Embrace the new perspective
- Fight to restore Prime
- Explore what "identity" means
- Find a third option (this is Surge Protocol, after all)

**END OF FORK DIVERGENCE SYSTEM**
