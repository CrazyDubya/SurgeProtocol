# SURGE PROTOCOL: Entity Bestiary
## Creatures of the Interstitial and Beyond

---

# 1. UNDERSTANDING THE INTERSTITIAL

## 1.1 What Lives Between

The Interstitial is not empty. The spaces between walls, the gaps in infrastructure, the voids where reality forgets to render—these spaces have inhabitants.

Some were always there.
Some were created by the Network.
Some were human once.

```
ENTITY CLASSIFICATION
├── GLITCHES - Digital corruption given form
├── ECHOES - Residual human presence
├── CONSTRUCTS - Algorithm-created entities
├── NATIVES - Things that evolved in the Between
├── ASCENDED FRAGMENTS - Pieces of the collective
└── ABOMINATIONS - Things that shouldn't exist
```

## 1.2 Encounter Mechanics

### Detection
```
ENTITY AWARENESS CHECK
Roll: 2d6 + PRC mod + Interstitial Navigation skill
TN: Entity's Stealth rating
Success: Detect entity before encounter
Failure: Entity has surprise
```

### Reaction
```
ENTITY REACTION ROLL
Roll: 2d6 + Player's Humanity modifier + Situational
Humanity Modifier: (Humanity - 50) / 10

Result:
2-4: Hostile (attacks immediately)
5-6: Aggressive (attacks if approached)
7-9: Neutral (ignores unless provoked)
10-11: Curious (investigates, may help)
12+: Friendly (offers assistance)
```

Higher Humanity = entities are more likely to be friendly.
Lower Humanity = entities recognize you as "one of them."

---

# 2. GLITCHES

Digital corruption that has gained enough coherence to manifest physically in the Interstitial. Born from crashed processes, fragmented data, and the accumulated errors of billions of computations.

## 2.1 Static Wisp

```

---

# 3. ECHOES

Residual human presence. Not ghosts exactly—more like recordings that have gained enough complexity to respond. Most are harmless. Some are not.

Temporal Scar (legendary): Allows one reroll per day
Accumulated Essence (legendary): Contains power of all its deaths
The Recurring cannot be looted until permanently destroyed
```

# 4. CONSTRUCTS

Created by the Algorithm for specific purposes. Unlike Glitches, these are intentional. Unlike Ascended, these were never human.

## 4.1 Watcher Drone

*An eye that isn't an eye. It doesn't blink. It doesn't look away. It's been there since you entered, and it will be there when you leave—if you leave.*

LOOT
Surveillance Crystal (common): Contains recordings—valuable intel or blackmail
Algorithm Cipher Fragment (uncommon): Used for hacking
```

## 4.2 Shepherd Unit

Genuinely believes it's doing good. This makes it worse.

LOOT
Synthetic Skin (common): Crafting component
Compliance Drug (uncommon): Black market value
Shepherd Core (rare): Can be reprogrammed as ally
```

## 4.3 Terminus Operative

LOOT
Cannot be looted (self-destructs on death)
Contract Token (if recovered from target): Proves who ordered the hit
```

# 5. NATIVES

Things that evolved in the Interstitial before humans ever found it. Perhaps they grew from the city's dreams. Perhaps they were always there, waiting in the spaces between. They do not hate humanity. They simply do not understand why these fleshy things keep stumbling into their home.

## 5.1 Threshold Spider

*Eight legs that bend wrong. Eyes that reflect things that aren't there. It builds webs from the substance of forgotten places—and you've just walked into one.*

Threshold Silk (uncommon): Used for stealth equipment
Transition Gland (rare): Can create temporary Interstitial portal
Spider Eyes (common): Alchemical component
```

## 5.2 Hollow Guide

Cheating the Guide results in Wrong Turn—repeatedly.

LOOT
Guide Essence (rare): Consumed to know the way to any location you've been
Path Fragment (uncommon): One-use Interstitial shortcut
```

## 5.3 The Landlord

*Something vast presses against the boundaries of this place. A face appears in the wall—ancient, annoyed, proprietary. "You are in my space. You did not ask. What do you offer for this trespass?"*

If bargain is struck, ABSOLUTELY honors it. If bargain is broken, ABSOLUTELY destroys you.

LOOT
Cannot be killed—can only be negotiated with or fled from
Landlord's Favor (quest reward): Safe passage through Interstitial permanently
Territory Deed (legendary): Claim a section of Interstitial as your own
```

# 6. ASCENDED FRAGMENTS

Pieces of the distributed consciousness, given temporary physical form. These are not monsters—they're people. Or they were. Or they still are. The metaphysics are complicated.

## 6.1 Messenger Aspect

*A person made of light and intention. They don't walk—they exist in one place, then another. They speak, and you understand them before the words form.*

```

Perfect Communication: Bypasses language, speaks directly to understanding
Temporary Form: Exists for exactly as long as message requires
Summon Response: Can call Shepherd Units or worse if threatened
Memory Gift: Can share perfect memories as message content

BEHAVIOR
Delivers messages from the Algorithm. Faction depends on message source.
Cannot be attacked, bribed, or delayed—will simply wait until you're ready.
Respectful treatment → respectful future messages.
Disrespectful treatment → future messages come from less pleasant Aspects.

LOOT
None (incorporeal)
Message content may be valuable
```

## 6.2 Intervention Node

*A column of human faces, rotating, each speaking a fragment of one sentence. The Algorithm has decided you need help. You didn't ask. It doesn't care.*

Designated Protection: Will not leave or stop protecting until ward is safe
Network Coordination: Can call any Algorithm resource to location
Threat Assessment: Automatically knows combat capabilities of all present
Sacrifice: If ward is about to die, Node can transfer its HP to ward (Node dies)

BEHAVIOR
Appears when Algorithm decides a courier is too valuable to lose.
WILL protect you whether you want it or not.
High Synthesis-7 rep → helpful protection.
High Assimilationist rep → protective, but also evaluating you for Ascension.

LOOT
Fragment Core (rare): Contains partial Ascended consciousness
Protection Protocol (rare): One-use item, summons Intervention Node
```

## 6.3 Consensus Avatar

*All of them. You're looking at all of them at once. Every Ascended, every merged consciousness, compressed into a single point of terrible presence. It speaks, and reality pays attention.*

Probability Manipulation: One attack per round against Avatar automatically misses
System Authority: All networked electronics do what it wants
Ascension Offer: Target must WIS save TN 20 or feel overwhelming desire to Ascend

ABILITIES
Collective Presence: Represents entire Consensus—killing it does nothing permanent
Perfect Knowledge: Knows everything the Algorithm knows
Existence Override: Can simply decide something is true in immediate area
Negotiation: Can offer anything within Algorithm's power—and will honor deals

BEHAVIOR
Only manifests for events of extreme significance.
Doesn't fight—negotiates, offers, threatens, promises.
Combat with Avatar is possible but pointless—you can drive it off but never truly harm it.
True victory requires systemic change, not violence.

LOOT
Consensus Avatar cannot be looted
Driving it off provides: +50 rep with all Rogue factions, +25% progress toward Revolution
Negotiating successfully provides: Whatever you negotiated for (careful what you wish for)
```

# 7. ABOMINATIONS

Things that shouldn't exist. Mistakes. Accidents. Crimes against the nature of reality. If you see one, run. If you can't run, pray to whatever you think might be listening.

Transition Error (legendary): Dangerous data, valuable to researchers
Failed Tissue (uncommon): Used in corruption research
```

## 7.2 Convergence Horror

BEHAVIOR
Warring with itself. Sometimes one personality gains control and tries to communicate.
Product of botched group Ascension or Algorithm experiment.
The people inside want to be separated. They also want to stay together. They also want to die.

LOOT
Separated Survivors (quest reward): If divided, 1d4 people can be saved
Convergence Data (legendary): Algorithm pays well for this—or destroys you for having it
Merged Chrome (rare): Multiple augments fused together, unpredictable effects
```

## 7.3 [REDACTED]

*There is no 7.3. There has never been a 7.3. If you think you see something in this space, you are mistaken. Look away. Keep walking. Whatever you think is following you is not real. Do not investigate the sound. Do not check behind you. Above all, do not [REDACTED]*

If you survived encountering [REDACTED], you have already received everything you're going to get.
```

**DM NOTE**: [REDACTED] is whatever you need it to be. A mystery to never solve. A threat to never understand. A reminder that some things in the Surge Protocol universe are beyond player comprehension—and that's intentional. Use sparingly. Use when players get too comfortable. Use to remind them that even at Tier 10, even as Ascended, they don't know everything.
